Keen Mr. Ludolph saw and read his physician's expression accurately. Seizing his hand he said,
eagerly: "Pardon me, doctor; you can understand a father's feelings. Watch this case night
and day. Spare no pains, and be assured I will regret no expense"; and he hastened away to
his daughter's bedside.

No prisoner at the bar ever listened with more interest than Dennis. If it had been his own
case they were discussing it would not have touched him half so nearly.

But a moment before, Christine in her pride, wealth, and beauty seemed destined to go through
life as in a triumphant march. Now he saw her to be a weak human creature, threatened as sorely
as the poorest and humblest. Her glorious beauty, even her life, might pass away in Le Grand
Hotel as surely as in a tenement house. The very thought thrilled him with fear. Then a great
pity rushed into his soul like a tide, sweeping everything before it. His stern resolution
to stifle and trample upon his love melted like a snow-wreath, and every interest of life centred
in the darkened room where Christine tossed and moaned in the deeper darkness of uncertainty
and doubt. The longing to go to her with comfort and help was so intense that it required the
utmost effort of reason and will to prevent such rash action. He trembled at himself--at the
strength of his feelings--and saw that though he might control outward action his heart had
gone from him beyond remedy, and that his love, so long unrecognized, was now like the principal
source of the Jordan, that springs from the earth a full-grown river, and that he could not
help it.

Mr. Ludolph found little comfort at his daughter's bedside. Sending her maid away, who was
glad to go, Christine told what she had overheard. Smallpox seemed in the mind of every one,
but this was not strange since it was so prevalent in the city.

"Oh, father, what shall I do--what shall I do, if this should be the case? Janette will leave
me, and there will be no one to take care of me. I know I shall die, and I might as well as
to be made hideous by this horrible disease. No, I would rather live, on any terms; for to
die is to be nothing. Oh, father, are you sure the Bible is all false? There is so much in
it to comfort the sick. If I could only believe in such a life hereafter as Susie Winthrop
does, I would as soon die as not."

"No," said Mr. Ludolph, firmly, "your only chance is to get well. There is no use in deceiving
ourselves. I have secured the services of the most skilful of physicians, and will see that
you have every attention. So try to be as calm as possible, and co-operate with every effort
to baffle and banish disease. After all it may be nothing more than a severe cold."

So then in very truth this world was all. In bitterness and dread she realized how slight was
her hold upon it. To her healthful body pain was a rare experience, but now her head and every
bone ached, and the slightest movement caused increased suffering. But her mental trouble was
by far the greatest. Often she murmured to herself, "Oh, that I had been trained to the grossest
superstitions, so that I might not look down into this black bottomless gulf that unbelief
opens at my feet!" and she tossed and moaned most piteously.

Mr. Ludolph returned to the store in an exceedingly worried and anxious state. As he entered
he caught Dennis's eager, questioning gaze, and a thought struck him: "Perhaps this young fellow,
through his mission school, may know of some good, trustworthy woman who would act as nurse";
and coming to Dennis he explained the situation, and then asked if he knew of any one, or could
find a suitable person.

Dennis listened eagerly, thought a moment, and then said, with a flushed face and in a low
tone: "I think my mother would be willing to come. We

"In the vast cathedral leave him; God accept him, Christ receive him!"

IV

If we go now and look on these innumerable epitaphs, the pathos and
the irony are strangely fled.

They do not stand merely to the dead, these foolish monuments; they
are pillars and legends set up to glorify the difficult but not desperate
life of man.

This ground is hallowed by the heroes of defeat.

I see the indifferent
pass before my friend's last resting-place; pause, with a shrug of
pity, marvelling that so rich an argosy had sunk. He had been speaking for his mother from his own
point of view, and now he hardly knew what to say, for he was not good at evasion. But he told
the truth, if not all the truth. "We feel very grateful to you for the means of support, and
a chance in life when the world was very dark. You have since promoted me--"

"Nonsense!" said Mr. Ludolph, somewhat touched, though; "you have earned every dollar you have
received, and your coming has been of advantage to me also. But if your mother will meet this
need, should it occur, neither of you will have cause to regret it"; and he passed on to his
office, but soon after went away again and did not return that day.

To Dennis the hours dragged on like years, full of suspense and mental tumult. At times he
would bow his head behind his counter, and pray in tearful fervor for the object of his constant
thought. The day was rainy, and the store empty of customers, for which he was most thankful,
as he would have made the poorest of salesmen. At last the hour for closing arrived, and he
was left to himself. In the solitude of his own room he once more looked the situation fairly
in the face. With his head bowed in his hands he reflected: "Last night I thought to tear this
love from my heart, but to-night I find that this would be to tear out my heart itself. I cannot
do it. It is my strongest conviction that I can no more stop loving her than I can stop living.
Unconsciously this love has grown until now it is my master, and it is folly to make any more
resolves, only to be as weak as water when I least expect it. What shall I do?"

Motionless, unconscious of the lapse of time, he remained hour after hour absorbed in painful
thought. Circumstances, reason, the Bible, all seemed to frown upon his love; but, though it
appeared to be hopeless, his whole nature revolted against the idea of its being wrong.

"It cannot be wrong to love, purely and unselfishly," he muttered. "Such love as mine seems
to carry its own conviction of right with it--an inner consciousness that seems so strong and
certain as to be beyond argument--beyond everything; and yet if God's Word is against it I
must be wrong, and my heart is misleading me."

Again in unbroken silence an hour passed away. Then the thought struck him: "It is not contrary
to God's action! He so loved the world--unbelievers and all--as to give His best and dearest!
Can it be wrong to be God-like?"

"It is not wise, it is not safe," prudence whispered, "to give a worldly, unbelieving spirit
the power to influence you that she will have who is first in your heart. What true congeniality
can there be? As the most intimate friend and companion in life, you should seek one who truly
can be one with you in all things, and most assuredly so in this vital respect."

"Ah," thought Dennis, "that would have been very good advice to give awhile ago. If from the
first I could have understood my feelings and danger, I might have steeled my heart against
the influences that have brought me to this. But the mischief is done. The words that now,
in spite of myself, continually run in my mind, are, 'What God hath joined together let not
man put asunder.' It seems as if some resistless power had joined my soul to hers, and I find
no strength within myself to break the bond. I am not usually irresolute; I think I have principle;
and yet I feel that I should not dare make the most solemn vow against this love. I should
be all the more weak because conscience does not condemn me. It seems to have a light that
reason and knowledge know not of. And yet I wish I could be more sure. I wish I could say to
myself, I may be loving hopelessly, but not sinfully. I would take the risk. Indeed I cannot
help taking it. Oh, that I could find light, clear and unmistakable!"

He rose, turned up his light, and opened the Pauline precepts. These words struck his eyes,
"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed."

"Am I not bound--bound by that which is God's link in the chain? It does not seem as if the
legal contract could change or strengthen my feelings materially, and while honoring the inviolable
rite of marriage, which is God's law and society's safety, I know that nothing can more surely
bind me to her, so that the spirit, the vital part of the passage, applies to me. Then if through
this love I could save her--if by prayer and effort I could bring her feet into the paths of
life-- I should feel repaid for all that I could possibly suffer. She may slight my human love
with its human consummation, but God will not let a life of prayer and true love be wasted,
and she may learn here, or know hereafter, that though the world laid many rich gifts at her
feet I brought the best of all."

He looked out, and saw that the early spring dawn was tingeing the horizon.

"A good omen," he said aloud. "Perhaps the night of this trouble is past, and the dawn is coming.
I am convinced that it is not wrong; and I am resolved to make the almost desperate attempt.
A mysterious hope, coming from I know not where or what, seems to beckon and encourage me forward."

Dennis was young.

CHAPTER XXVI

MISS LUDOLPH COMMITS A THEFT

Mr. Ludolph on his return found Christine suffering from a nervous horror of the smallpox.
From the indiscreet and callous maid, intent on her own safety, and preparing to palliate the
cowardice of her flight should her fears prove true, Christine learned that the city was full
of this loathsome disease, and her feelings were harrowed by exaggerated instances of its virulent
and contagious character.

"But you will surely stay with me," pleaded Christine.

"Mademoiselle could not expect zat."

"Heartless!" muttered Christine. Then she said: "Won't you go for Susie Winthrop? Oh, how I
would like to see her now!"

"She vould not come; no von vould come who knew."

Christine wrung her hands and cried, "Oh, I shall die alone and deserted of all!"

"No, you shall not," said her father, entering at that moment; "so do not give way, my dear.--Leave
the room, stupid!" (to the maid, who again gladly escaped, resolving not to re-enter till the
case was decided). "I have secured the best of physicians, and the best of nurses, and by to-night
or to-morrow morning we shall know about what to expect. I cannot help hoping still that it
is only a severe cold." And he told her of Dennis's offer of his mother's services.

"I am sure I should like her, for somehow I picture to myself a kind, motherly person. What
useful creatures those Fleets are! They are on hand in emergencies when one so needs help.
It seemed very nice to have young Fleet my humble servant; but really, father, he deserves
promotion."

"He shall have it, and I doubt not will be just as ready to do your bidding as ever. It is
only commonplace people whose heads are turned by a little prosperity. Fleet knew he was a
gentleman before he came to the store."

"Father, if I should have the smallpox and live, would my beaut--would I become a fright?"

"Not necessarily. Let us hope for the best. Make the most of the world, and never endure evils
till they come, are my maxims. Half of suffering is anticipation of possible or probable evil."

"Father," said Christine, abruptly, "I believe you are right, you must be right, and have given
me the best comfort and hope that truthfully can be given. But this is a strange, cruel world.
We seem the sport of circumstances, the victims of hard, remorseless laws. One bad person can
frightfully injure another person" (a spasm distorted her father's face). "What accidents may
occur! Worst of all are those horrible, subtle, contagious diseases which, none can see or
guard against! Then to suffer, die, corrupt--faugh! To what a disgusting end, to what a lame
and impotent conclusion, does the noble creature, man, come! My whole nature revolts at it.
For instance, here am I a young girl, capable of the highest enjoyment, with everything to
live for, and lured forward by the highest hopes and expectations; and yet, in spite of all
the safeguards you can place around me, my path is in the midst of dangers, and now perhaps
I am to be rendered hideous, if not killed outright, by a disease the very thought of which
fills me with loathing. What I fear has happened, and may happen again. And what compensation
is there for it all?--what can enable one to bear it all? Oh, that I could believe in a God
and a future happier life!"

"And what kind of a God would He be who, having the power to prevent, permits, or orders, as
the Bible teaches, all these evils? I am a man of the world, and pretend to nothing saint-like
or chivalric, but do you think I am capable of going to Mr. Winthrop and striking down his
daughter Susie with a loathsome disease? And yet if a minister or priest should come here he
would begin to talk about the mysterious providence, and submission to God's will. If I am
to have a God, I want one at least better than myself."

"You must be right," said Christine, with a weary moan. "There is no God, and if there were,
in view of what you say, I could only hate and fear Him. How chaotic the world is! But it is
hard." After a moment she added, shudderingly: "It is horrible. I did not think of these things
when well."

"Get well and forget them again, my dear. It is the best you can do."

"If I get well," said Christine, almost fiercely, "I shall get the most I can out of life,
cost what it may;" and she turned her face to the wall.

A logical result of his teaching, but for some reason it awakened in Mr. Ludolph a vague foreboding.

The hours dragged on, and late in the afternoon the hard-driven physician appeared, examined
his patient, and seemed relieved.

"If there is no change for the worse," he said, cheerily, "if no new symptoms develop by to-morrow,
I can pronounce this merely a severe cold, caused by the state of the system and too sudden
check of perspiration;" and the doctor gave and opiate and bowed himself out.

Long and heavily Christine slept. The night that Dennis filled with agonizing prayer and thought
was to her a blank. While he in his strong Christian love brought heaven nearer to her, while
he resolved on that which would give her a chance for life, happy life, here and hereafter,
she was utterly unconscious. No vision or presentiment of good, like a struggling ray of light,
found access to her darkened spirit. So heavy was the stupor induced by the opiate, that her
sleep seemed like the blank she so feared, when her brilliant, ambitious life should end in
nothingness.

So I suppose God's love meditates good, and resolves on life and joy for us, while our hearts
are sleeping, dead to Him, benumbed and paralyzed so that only His love can awaken them. Like
a vague yet hope-inspiring dream, this truth often enters the minds of those who are wrapped
in the spiritual lethargy that may end in death. God wakes, watches, loves, and purposes good
for them. When we are most unconscious, perhaps another effect for our salvation has been resolved
upon in the councils of heaven.

But ambition more than love, earthly hopes rather than heavenly, kept Mr. Ludolph an anxious
watcher at Christine's side that night. A smile of satisfaction illumined his somewhat haggard
face as he saw the fever pass away and the dew of natural moisture come out on Christine's
brow, but there was no thankful glance upward. Immunity from loathsome disease was due only
to chance and the physician's skill, by his creed.

The sun was shining brightly when Christine awoke and by a faint call startled her father from
a doze in the great armchair.

"How do you feel, my dear?" he asked.

She languidly rubbed her heavy eyes, and said she thought she was better--she felt no pain.
The opiate had not yet lost its effect. But soon she greatly revived, and when the doctor came
he found her decidedly better, and concluded that she was merely suffering from a severe cold,
and would soon regain her usual health.

Father and daughter were greatly relieved, and their spirits rose.

"I really feel as if I ought to thank somebody," said Christine. "I am not going to thank the
doctor, for I know what a bill is coming, so I will thank you. It was very kind of you to sit
up the long night with me."

Even Mr. Ludolph had to remember that he had in his anxiety thought as much of himself as of her.

"Another lease of life," said Christine, dreamily looking into the future; "and, as I said
last night, I mean to make the most of it."

"I can best guide you in doing that," said her father, looking into his daughter's face with
keen scrutiny.

"I believe you, and intend to give you the chance. When can we leave this detested land, this
city of shops and speculators? To think that I, Christine Ludolph, am sick, idle, and perhaps
have endangered all by reason of foolish exposure in a brewer's tawdry, money-splashed house!
Come, father when is the next scene in the brief drama to open? I am impatient to go home to
our beloved Germany and enter on real life."

"Well, my dear, if all goes well, we can enter on our true career a year from next fall--a
short year and a half. Do not blame the delay, for it will enable us to live in Germany in
almost royal style. I never was making money so rapidly as now. I have invested in that which
cannot depreciate, and thus far has advanced beyond belief--buildings in the business part
of the city. Rents are paying me from twenty to a hundred per cent. At the same time I could
sell out in a month. So you see you have only to co-operate with me--to preserve health and
strength--to enjoy all that money can insure; and money can buy almost everything."

Christine's eyes sparkled as the future opened before her, and she said, with emphasis, "If
I could preserve health and strength, I would live a thousand years."

"You can do much toward it. Every chance is in favor of prudence and wise action;" and, much
relieved, her father went to the store.

Business had accumulated, and in complete absorption he gave himself to it. With an anxiety
beyond expression, Dennis, flushed and trembling, ventured to approach. Merely glancing to
see who it was, Mr. Ludolph, with his head bent over his writing, said, "Miss Ludolph is better--
no fear of smallpox, I think--you need not write to your mother--greatly obliged."

It was well for Dennis that his employer did not look up. The open face of Mr. Ludolph's clerk
expressed more than friendly interest in his daughter's health. The young man went to his tasks
with a mountain of fear lifted from his heart.

But the thought of the beloved one lying alone and sick at the hotel seemed very pathetic to
him. Love filled his heart with more sympathy for Christine upon her luxurious couch, in rapid
convalescence, than for all the hopeless suffering of Chicago. What could he do for her? She
seemed so far off, so high and distant, that he could not reach her. If he ventured to send
anything, prudence whispered that she would regard it as an impertinence. But love can climb
every steep place, and prudence is not its grand-vizier.

Going by a fruit-store in the afternoon he saw some fine strawberries, the first in from the
South. He bought a basket, decorated it with German ivy obtained at a flower-stand, and spirited
it upstairs to his room as if it were the most dangerous of contraband. In a disguised hand
he wrote on a card, "For Miss Ludolph." Calling Ernst, who had little to do at that hour of
the day, he said: "Ernst, my boy, take this parcel to Le Grand Hotel, and say it is for Miss
Christine Ludolph. Tell them to send it right up, but on no account--remember, on no account--tell
any one who sent it. Carry it carefully in just this manner."

Ernst was soon at his destination, eager to do anything for his friend.

After all, the day had proved a long one for Christine. Unaccustomed to the restraints of sickness,
she found the enforced inaction very wearisome. Mind and body both seemed weak. The sources
of chief enjoyment when well seemed powerless to contribute much now. In silken robe she reclined
in an arm-chair, or languidly sauntered about the room. She took up a book only to throw it
down again. Her pencil fared no better. Ennui gave to her fair young face the expression of
one who had tried the world for a century and found it wanting. She was leaning her elbow on
the window-sill, gazing vacantly into the street, when Ernst appeared.

"Janette," she said, suddenly, "do you see that boy? He is employed at the store. Go bring
him up here; I want him;" and with more animation than she had shown that day she got out materials
for a sketch.

"I must get that boy's face," she said, "before good living destroys all his artistic merit."

Ernst was unwilling to come, but the maid almost dragged him up.

"What have you got there?" asked Miss Ludolph, with a reassuring smile.

"Something for Miss Ludolph," stammered the boy, looking very much embarrassed.

Christine carefully opened the parcel and then exclaimed with delight: "Strawberries, as I
live! the very ambrosia of the gods. Papa sent them, did he not?"

"No," said the boy, hanging his head.

"Who did, then?" said Christine, looking at him keenly.

He shuffled uneasily, but made no answer.

"Come, I insist on knowing," she cried, her wilful spirit and curiosity both aroused.

The boy was pale and frightened, and she was mentally taking notes of his face. But he said,
doggedly, "I can't tell."

"But I say you must. Don't you know that I am Miss Ludolph?"

"I don't care what you do to me," said the little fellow, beginning to cry, "I won't tell."

"Why won't you tell, my boy?" said Christine, cunningly, in a wheedling tone of voice.

Before he knew it, the frightened, bewildered boy fell into the trap, and he sobbed, "Because
Mr. Fleet told me not to, and I wouldn't disobey him to save my life."

A look of surprise, and then a broad smile, stole over the young girl's face--at the gift,
the messenger, and at him who sent it. It was indeed a fresh and unexpected little episode,
breaking the monotony of the day--as fresh and pleasing to her as one of the luscious berries
so grateful to her parched mouth.

"You need not tell me," she said, soothingly, "if Mr. Fleet told you not to."

The boy saw the smile, and in a moment realized that he had been tricked out of the forbidden
knowledge.

His little face glowed with honest indignation, and looking straight at Miss Ludolph, with
his great eyes flashing through the tears, he said, "You stole that from me."

Even she colored a little and bit her lip under the merited charge. But all this made him all
the more interesting as an art study, and she was now sketching away rapidly. She coolly replied,
however, "You don't know the world very well yet, my little man."

The boy said nothing, but stood regarding her with his unnaturally large eyes filled with anger,
reproach, and wonder.

"Oh," thought Christine, "if I could only paint that expression!"

"You seem a great friend of Mr. Fleet," she said, studying and sketching him as if he had been
an inanimate object.

The boy made no answer.

"Perhaps you do not know that I am a friend--friendly," she added, correcting herself, "to
Mr. Fleet also."

"Mr. Fleet never likes to have his friends do wrong," said the boy, doubtingly.

Again she colored a little, for Ernst's pure and reproachful face made her feel that she had
done a mean thing, but she laughed said: "You see I am not in his mission class, and have never
had the instruction that you have. But, after all, why do you think Mr. Fleet better than other
people?"

"By what he does."

"That is a fair test; what has he done?"

"He saved us all from starving, and worse than starving."

Then with feminine tact she drew from him his story, and it was told with deep feeling and
the natural pathos of childhood, and his gratitude caused him to dwell with a simple eloquence
on the part Dennis had taken, while his rich and loved German accent made it all the more interesting
to Christine. She dropped her pencil, and, when he finished, her eyes, that were seldom moistened
by the dew of sympathy, were wet.

"Good-by, my child," she said, in a voice so kind and sweet that it seemed as if another person
had spoken. "You shall come again, and then I shall finish my sketch. When I get well I shall
go to see your father's picture. Do not be afraid; neither you nor Mr. Fleet will fare the
worse for the strawberries, and you may tell him that they have done me much good."

When Dennis, wondering at Ernst's long absence, heard from him his story, his mind was in a
strange tumult, and yet the result of his effort seemed favorable.   But he learned more fully
than ever that Christine was not perfect, and that her faultless beauty and taste were but
the fair mask of a deformed spirit. But he dwelt in hope on the feeling she had shown at Ernst's
story.

"She seemed to have two hearts," said the boy--"a good, kind one way inside the cold, hard
outside one."

"That is about the truth," thought Dennis. "Good-night, Ernst. I don't blame you, my boy, for
you did the best you could."

He had done better than Dennis knew.

CHAPTER XXVII

A MISERABLE TRIUMPH

After Ernst's departure Christine reclined wearily in her chair, quite exhausted by even the
slight effort she had made, but her thoughts were busy.

"What a unique character that Dennis Fleet is! And yet, in view of what he believes and professes,
he is both natural and consistent. He seems humble only in station, and that is not his fault.
Everything he does seems marked by unusual good taste and intelligence. His earlier position
and treatment in the store must have been very galling. I can hardly believe that the gentleman
I sang Mendelssohn's music with the other evening was the same that I laughed at as he blacked
old Schwartz's boots. And yet he saw me laugh, and blacked the boots, conscious that he was
a gentleman. It must have been very hard. And yet I would rather do such work myself than live
on charity, and so undoubtedly he felt. It is very fortunate that we nearly finished the rearrangement
of the pictures before all this occurred, for I could not order him about now as I have done.
The fact is, I like servants, not dignified helpers; and knowing what I do, even if he would
permit it, I could not speak to him as formerly. But he did show wonderful taste and skill
in his help. See now that little ivy-twined basket of luscious fruit: it looks just like him.
If he were only rich and titled, what a genuine nobleman he would make! He is among the few
men who do not weary or disgust me; so many are coarse and commonplace. I cannot understand
it, but I, who fear and care for no one except my father, almost feared him when under Miss
Brown's insolence he looked as few men can. What a jumble the world is! He sweeps the store,
while insignificant atoms of men are conspicuous in their littleness by reason of high position.

"It was very kind of him to send me this tasteful gift after the miserable experience I caused
him the other day. I suppose he does it on the principle of returning good for evil, as his
creed teaches. Moreover, he seems grateful that father gave him employment, and a chance to
earn twice what he receives. He certainly must be promoted at once.

"Perhaps," thought she, smiling to herself, while a faint tinge of color came into her cheeks--"perhaps,
like so many others, he may be inclined to be a little sentimental also, though he will never
be as silly as some of them.

"What a noble part he acted toward those Bruders! The heart of a pagan could not fail to be
touched by that poor little fellow's story, and it has made me believe that I have more heart
than I supposed. Sometimes, especially when I hear or read of some such noble deed, I catch
glimpses of a life infinitely better than the one I know, like the sun shining through a rift
in the clouds; then they shut down again, and father's practical wisdom seems the best there is.

"At any rate," she said aloud, getting up and walking the floor with something of the old restless
energy, "I intend to live while I live, and crowd into life's brief day all that I can. I thank
Mr. Fleet for a few sensations in what would otherwise have been a monotonous, dreary afternoon."

"What, strawberries!" said Mr. Ludolph, coming in. "Where did you get these? They are the first
I have seen."

"Your man-of-all-work sent them to me," said Christine, daintily dipping one after another
in sugar.

"Well, that is a good joke."

"A most excellent one, which I am enjoying, and in which you may share. Help yourself."

"And what has led him to this extravagant favor?"

"Consistency, I suppose. As a good Christian he would return good for evil; and I certainly
caused him many and varied tortures the other day."

"No, he is grateful; from first to last the callow youth has been overwhelmed with gratitude
that I have permitted him to be worth to me double what I paid him."

"Well, you have decided to promote him, have you not?"

"Yes, he shall have charge of the hanging of new pictures, and the general arrangement of the
store, so as to keep up your tasteful and artistic methods. Moreover, he shall meet customers
at the door, and direct them just where to find what they want. He is fine-looking, polite,
speaks English perfectly, and thus takes well. I can gradually work him in as general salesman,
without creating troublesome jealousies."

"What will old Schwartz say?"

"Schwartz is good at finance and figures. I can trust him, and he must relieve me more in this
respect. He of course knows that this is the more important work, and will feel honored. As
to the others, if they do not like it I can find plenty who will. Fleet's good fortune will
take him quite by surprise. He was performing his old humble duties as briskly and contentedly
as usual to-day."

"I am surprised at that, for I should have supposed that he would have been on his dignity
somewhat, indicating by manner at least that the time for a change had come. He can indicate
a great deal by manner, as you might have learned had you seen him under Miss Brown's insults
and my lack of courtesy. Well, it does me good to find one American whose head is not turned
by a little success. You are right though, I think, father; that young fellow can be very useful
to you, and a decided help in hastening the time when we can leave this shop life, and enter
our true sphere. I am more impatient to go than words can express, for life seems so brief
and uncertain that we must grasp things as soon as possible or we lose them forever. Heavens!
what a scare I have had! Everything seemed slipping from under my feet yesterday, and I sinking
I know not where. Surely by concentrating every energy we can be ready to go by a year from
next fall."

"Yes, that is my plan now."

On the following day Dennis was again promoted and his pay increased. A man more of the Pat
Murphy type was found to perform the coarse work of the store. As Mr. Ludolph had said, Dennis
could hardly realize his good fortune. He felt like one lifted out of a narrow valley to a
breezy hillside. He was now given a vantage-point from which it seemed that he could climb
rapidly, and his heart was light as he thought of what he would be able to do for his mother
and sisters. Hope grew sanguine as he saw how he would now have the means to pursue his beloved
art-studies to far greater advantage. But, above all, his promotion brought him nearer the
object of his all-absorbing passion. What he feared would take him one or two years to accomplish
he had gained in a day. Hope whispered that perhaps it was through her influence in some degree
that he had obtained this advance. Could she have seen and read his ardent glances? Lovers'
hopes will grow like Jonah's gourd, and die down as quickly. Words could not express his longing
to see her again, but for several days she did not come to the store. She merely sent him word
to complete the unfinished show-room in accordance with the plan on which they had been working,
leaving space on the sides of the room opposite each other for two large pictures. Though much
disappointed, Dennis had carefully carried out her bidding.

Every evening the moment his duties permitted he sought his instructor, Mr. Bruder, and, with
an eagerness that his friends could not understand, sought to educate hand and eye. Dennis
judged rightly that mere business success would never open to him a way to the heart of such
a girl as Christine. His only hope of winning even her attention was to excel in the world
of art, where she hoped to shine as a queen. Then to his untiring industry and eager attention
he added real genius for his tasks, and it was astonishing what progress he made. When at the
close of his daily lesson Dennis had taken his departure, Mr. Bruder would shake his head,
and cast up his eyes in wonder, and exclaim: "Dot youth vill astonish de vorld yet. Never in
all Germany haf I seen such a scholar."

Often till after midnight he would study in the solitude of his own little room. And now, relieved
of duties in the early morning, he arranged an old easel in the attic of the store, a sort
of general lumber-room, yet with a good light for his purpose. Here he secured two good hours
daily, and often more, for painting; and his hand grew skilful, and his eye true, under his
earnest efforts. But his intense application caused his body to grow thin and his face pale.

Christine had rapidly recovered from her illness, her vital and elastic constitution rebounding
back into health and vigor like a bow rarely bent. She, too, was working scarcely less eagerly
than Dennis, and preparing for a triumph which she hoped would be the earnest of the fame she
meant to achieve. She no longer came to the store with her father in the morning, but spent
the best and early hours of the day in painting, riding out along the lake and in the park
in the afternoon. Occasionally she came to the store in the after part of the day, glanced
sharply round to see that her tasteful arrangement was kept up, and ever seemed satisfied.

Dennis was usually busy with customers at that time, and, though conscious of her presence
the moment she entered, found no excuse or encouragement to approach. The best he ever received
from her was a slight smile and a cold bow of recognition, and in her haste and self-absorption
she did not always give these. She evidently had something on her mind by which it was completely
occupied.

"She does not even think of me," sighed Dennis; "she evidently imagines that there is an immeasurable
distance between us yet."

He was right; she did not think of him, and scarcely thought of any one else, so absorbed was
she in the hope of a great success that now was almost sure. She had sent her thanks for the
berries by her father, which so frightened Dennis that he had ventured on no more such favors.
She had interceded for his promotion. Surely she had paid her debt, and was at quits. So she
would have been if he had only given her a basket of strawberries, but having given his heart,
and lifelong love, he could scarcely be expected to be satisfied. But he vowed after each blank
day all the more resolutely that he would win her attention, secure recognition of his equality,
and so be in position for laying siege to her heart.

But a deadly blight suddenly came over all his hopes.

One bright morning late in May two large flat boxes were brought to the store. Dennis was busy
with customers, and Mr. Schwartz said, in his blunt, decided way, that he would see to the
hanging of those pictures. They were carried to the show-room in the rear of the store, and
Dennis at once concluded that they were something very fine, designed to fill the spaces he
had left, and was most anxious to see them. Before he was disengaged they were lifted from
their casing and were standing side by side on the floor, opposite the entrance, the warm rich
morning light falling upon them with fine effect. Mr. Schwartz seemed unusually excited and
perplexed for him, and stared first at one picture, then at the other, in a manner indicating
that not their beauty, but some other cause disturbed him.

Dennis had scarcely had time to exclaim at the exquisite loveliness and finish of the two paintings
before Mr. Ludolph entered, accompanied by Mr. Cornell, a well-known artist, Mr. French, proprietor
of another large picture-store, and several gentlemen of taste, but of lesser note, whom Dennis
had learned to know by sight as habitues of the "Temple of Art." He also saw that Christine
was advancing up the store with a lady and gentleman. Feeling that his presence might be regarded
as obtrusive, he passed out, and was about to go away, when he heard his name called.

Looking up he saw Miss Winthrop holding out her hand, and in a moment more she presented him
to her father, who greeted him cordially. Christine also gave him a brief smile, and said:
"You need not go away. Come and see the pictures."

Quick-eyed Dennis observed that she was filled with suppressed excitement. Her cheeks, usually
but slightly tinged with pink, now by turns glowed and were pale. Miss Winthrop seemed to share
her nervousness, though what so excited them he could not divine. The paintings, beautiful
as they were, could scarcely be the adequate cause; and yet every eye was fastened on them.

One seemed the exact counterpart of the other in frame and finish as well as subject. A little
in the background, upon a crag overhanging the Rhine, was a castle, massive, frowning, and
built more for security and defence than comfort. The surrounding landscape was bold, wild,
and even gloomy. But in contrast with these rugged and sterner features, was a scene of exquisite
softness and tenderness. Beneath the shadow of some great trees not far from the castle gate,
a young crusader was taking leave of his fair-haired bride. Her pale, tearful face, wherein
love and grief blent indescribably, would move the most callous heart, while the struggle between
emotion and the manly pride that would not permit him to give way, in the young chieftain's
features, was scarcely less touching. Beautiful as were the accessories of the pictures, their
main point was to portray the natural, tender feeling induced by a parting that might be forever.
At first they all gazed quietly and almost reverently at the vivid scene of human love and
sorrow, save old Schwartz, who fidgeted about as Dennis had never seen him before. Clearly
something was wrong.

"Mr. Schwartz," said Mr. Ludolph, "you may hang the original picture on the side as we enter,
and the copy opposite. We would like to see them up, and in a better light."

"Dat's it," snorted Mr. Schwartz; "I'd like to know vich is vich."

"You do not mean to say that you cannot tell them apart? The original hung here some time,
and you saw it every day."

"I do mean to say him," said Mr. Schwartz, evidently much vexed with himself. "I couldn't have
believed dat any von in de vorld could so impose on me. But de two pictures are just de same
to a pin scratch in frame, subject, and treatment, and to save my life I cannot tell dem apart."

Christine's face fairly glowed with triumph, and her eyes were all aflame as she glanced at
her friend. Miss Winthrop came and took her cold, quivering hands into her own warm palms,
but was scarcely less excited. Dennis saw not this side scene, so intent was he on the pictures.

"Do you mean to say," said Mr. Cornell, stepping forward, "that one of these paintings is a
copy made here in Chicago, and that Mr. Schwartz cannot tell it from the original?"

"He says he cannot," said Mr. Ludolph.

"And I'd like to see the von who can," said old Schwartz, gruffly.

"Will you please point out the original," said one of the gentlemen, "that we may learn to
distinguish them? For my part they seem like the twins whose mother knew them apart by pink
and white ribbons, and when the ribbons got mixed she could not tell which was which."

Again Christine's eyes glowed with triumph.

"Well, really, gentlemen," said Mr. Ludolph, "I would rather you would discover the copy yourselves.
Mr. Cornell, Mr. French, and some others, I think, saw the original several times."

"Look at Mr. Fleet," whispered Miss Winthrop to Christine.

She looked, and her attention was riveted to him. Step by step, he had drawn nearer, and his
eyes were eagerly glancing from one picture to the other as if following up a clew. Instinctively
she felt that he would solve the question, and her little hands clenched, and her brow grew dark.

"Really," said Mr. Cornell, "I did not know that we had an artist in Chicago who could copy
the work of one of the best European painters so that there need be a moment's hesitancy in
detecting differences, but it seems I am mistaken. I am almost as puzzled as Mr. Schwartz."

"The frames are exactly alike," said Mr. French.

"There is a difference between the two pictures," said Mr. Cornell, slowly. "I can feel it
rather than see it. They seem alike, line for line and feature for feature, in every part;
and just where the difference lies and in what it consists I cannot tell for the life of me."

With the manner of one who had settled a difficult problem, Dennis gave a sigh of relief so
audible that several glanced at him.

"Perhaps Mr. Fleet from his superior knowledge and long experience can settle this question,"
said Christine, sarcastically.

All eyes were turned toward him. He flushed painfully, but said nothing.

"Speak up," said Mr. Ludolph, good-naturedly, "if you have any opinion to give."

"I would not presume to give my opinion among so many more competent judges."

"Come, Mr. Fleet," said Christine, with a covert taunt in her tone, "that is a cheap way of
making a reputation. I fear the impression will be given that you have no opinion."

Dennis was now very pale, as he ever was under great excitement. The old look came again that
the young ladies remembered seeing at Miss Brown's entertainment.

"Come, speak up if you can," said Mr. Ludolph shortly.

"Your porter, Mr. Ludolph?" said Mr. Cornell, remembering Dennis only in that capacity. "Perhaps
he has some private marks by which he can enlighten us."

Dennis now acted no longer as porter or clerk, but as a man among men.

Stepping forward and looking Mr. Cornell full in the face he said: "I can prove to you, sir,
that your insinuation is false by simply stating that I never saw those pictures before. The
original had been removed from the store before I came. I have had therefore no opportunity
of knowing the copy from the original. But the pictures are different, and I can tell precisely
wherein I think the difference lies."

"Tell it then," said several voices. Christine stood a little back and on one side, so that
he could not see her face, or he would have hesitated long before he spoke. In the firm, decided
tones of one thoroughly aroused and sure of his ground, he proceeded.

"Suppose this the copy," said he, stepping to one of the pictures. (Christine breathed hard
and leaned heavily against her friend.) "I know of but one in Chicago capable of such exquisite
work, and he did not do it; indeed he could not, though a master in art."

"You refer to Mr. Bruder?" said Mr. Cornell.

Dennis bowed and continued: "It is the work of one in whom the imitative power is wonderfully
developed; but one having never felt--or unable to feel--the emotions here presented cannot
portray them. This picture is but the beautiful corpse of that one. While line for line, and
feature for feature, and even leaf for leaf on the trees is faithfully exact, yet the soul,
the deep, sorrowful tenderness that you feel in that picture rather than see, is wanting in
this. In that picture you forget to blame or praise, to criticise at all, so deeply are your
sympathies touched. It seems as if in reality two human hearts were being torn asunder before
you. This you know to be an exquisite picture only, and can coolly criticise and dwell on every
part, and say how admirably it is done."

And Dennis bowed and retired.

"By Jove, he is right," exclaimed Mr. Cornell; and approving faces and nodding heads confirmed
his judgment. But Dennis enjoyed not his triumph, for as he turned he met Christine's look
of agony and hate, and like lightning it flashed through his mind, "She painted the picture."

CHAPTER XXVIII

LIFE WITHOUT LOVE

As Dennis realized the truth, and remembered what he had said, his face was scarcely less full
of pain than Christine's. He saw that her whole soul was bent on an imitation that none could
detect, and that he had foiled her purpose. But Christine's wound was deeper than that. She
had been told again, clearly and correctly, that the sphere of high, true art was beyond her
reach. She felt that the verdict was true, and her own judgment confirmed every word Dennis
uttered. But she had done her best; therefore her suffering was truly agony--the pain and despair
at failure in the most cherished hope of life. There seemed a barrier which, from the very
limitations of her being, she could not pass. She did not fail from the lack of taste, culture,
or skill, but in that which was like a sixth sense--something she did not possess. Lacking
the power to touch and move the heart, she knew she could never be a great artist.

Abruptly and without a word she left the room and store, accompanied by the Winthrops. Dennis
felt as if he could bite his tongue out, and Christine's face haunted him like a dreadful apparition.
Wherever he turned he saw it so distorted by pain, and almost hate, that it scarcely seemed
the same that had smiled on him as he entered at her invitation.

"Truly God is against all this," groaned he, to himself; "and what I in my weakness could not
do He has accomplished by this unlooked-for scene. She will now ever regard me with aversion."

Dennis, like many another, thought he saw God's plan clearly from a mere glimpse of a part
of it. He at once reached this miserable conclusion, and suffered as greatly as if it had been
God's will, instead of his own imagination. To wait and trust is often the latest lesson we
learn in life.

Mr. Ludolph's guests, absorbed in the pictures, at first scarcely noticed the departure of
the others.

Christine, with consummate skill and care, kept her relationship to the picture unknown to
all save the Winthrops, meaning not to acknowledge it unless she succeeded. But in Dennis's
startled and pained face she saw that he had read her secret, and this fact also annoyed her much.

"I should like to know the artist who copied this painting," said Mr. Cornell.

"The artist is an amateur, and not willing to come before the public at present," said Mr.
Ludolph, so decidedly that no further questions were asked.

"I am much interested in that young clerk of yours," said Mr. French. "He seems to understand
himself.  It is so hard to find a good discriminating judge of pictures. Do you expect to keep
him?"

"Yes, I do," said Mr. Ludolph, with such emphasis that his rival in trade pressed that point
also no further.

"Well, really, Mr. Ludolph," said one of the gentlemen, "you deal in wonders, mysteries, and
all sorts of astonishing things yere. We have an unknown artist in Chicago deserving an ovation;
you have in your employ a prince of critics, and if I mistake not he is the same who sang at
Brown's some little time ago. Miss Brown told me that he was your porter."

"Yes, I took him as a stranger out of work and knew nothing of him. But he proved to be an
educated and accomplished man, who will doubtless be of great use to me in time. Of course
I promoted him when I found him out." These last remarks were made for Mr. French's benefit
rather than for any one's else. He intended that his rival should knowingly violate all courtesy
if he sought to lure Dennis away. After admiring the paintings and other things recently received,
the gentlemen bowed themselves out.

On leaving the store Mr. Winthrop--feeling awkward in the presence of the disappointed girl--had
pleaded business, and bidden her adieu with a warm grasp of the hand and many assurances that
she had succeeded beyond his belief.

"I know you mean kindly in what you say," said Christine, while not the slightest gleam lighted
up her pale, sad face. "Good-by."

She, too, was relieved, and wished to be alone. Miss Winthrop sought to comfort her friend
as they walked homeward.

"Christine, you look really ill. I don't see why you take this matter so to heart. You have
achieved a success that would turn any head but yours. I could not believe it possible had
I not seen it. Your ambition and ideal are so lofty that you will always make yourself miserable
by aiming at the impossible. As Mr. Fleet said, I do not believe there is another in the city
who could have done so well, and if you can do that now, what may you not accomplish by a few
years more of work?"

"That's the terrible part of it," said Christine, with a long sigh. "Susie, I have attained
my growth. I can never be a real artist and no one living can ever know the bitterness of my
disappointment. I do not believe in the immortality that you do, and this was my only chance
to live beyond the brief hour of my life. If I could only have won for myself a place among
the great names that the world will ever honor, I might with more content let the candle of
my existence flicker out when it must. But I have learned to-day what I have often feared--that
Christine Ludolph must soon end in a forgotten handful of dust."

"Oh, Christine, if you could only believe!"

"I cannot. I tried in my last sickness, but vainly. No, this would not explain our delight in the colors
of nature.

Or do color effects constitute problems that challenge the mastery
impulse?

This might fit the case of intricate color designs, but not the strong, simple color effects
that appeal to most people. There is no escape from the conclusion that color is liked for its
own sake, and that this primary liking is the foundation of color art.

Music, in the same way, is certainly based on a primary liking for tones and their combinations,
as well as for rhythm. Novel effects also appeal to curiosity, musical performance is a means
of display to the performer, and the problem set by a piece of music to the performer in the
{183} way of execution, and to the listener in the way of understanding and appreciation, gives
plenty of play to the mastery impulse.

Besides, music gets associated with love, tenderness, war and religion;
but none of the impulses thus gratified by music is the fundamental
reason for music, since without the primary taste for tone and rhythm
there would be no music to start with, and therefore no chance for
these various impulses to find an outlet in this direction.

Still another field of human activity, in which native likes and dislikes
play their part alongside of the instincts, is the field of social
life.

The gregarious instinct brings individuals together into social groups, and probably also makes
the individual crave participation in the doings of the group. The sex instinct lends a special
interest to those members of the group who are of the opposite sex,
and the parental instinct leads the adults to take a protective attitude
towards the little children.

Also, it is probably due to the parental instinct that any one spontaneously
seeks to help the helpless.

Self-assertion has plenty of play in a group, both in the way of seeking to dominate and in
the way of resisting domination; and the submissive tendency finds an outlet in admiring and
following those who far surpass us. Thwarted self-assertion accounts for many of the dislikes
that develop between the members of a group. But none of these instincts accounts for the
interest in personality, or for the genuine liking that people may have for one another.

Let a group of persons of the same age and sex get together, all equals
for the time being, no one seeking to dominate the rest, no one bowing
to another as his superior nor chafing against an assumed superiority
which he does not admit, no one in a helpless or unfortunate condition
that arouses the pity of the rest.

What an uninteresting affair! No instincts called into play except bare gregariousness! {184}
On the contrary, such a group affords almost or quite the maximum of social pleasure. It affords
scope for comradeship and good fellowship, which are based on a native
liking for people, and not on the instincts.



"Yes, I saw that he discovered the fact, and this provokes me also. If he should speak his
thoughts--"

"I do not think he will. I am sure he will not if you caution him."

"That I will not do; and I think on the whole he has too much sense to speak carelessly of
what he imagined he saw in a lady's face. And now, Susie, good-by. I shall not inflict my miserable
self longer upon you to-day, and I am one who can best cure my wounds in solitude."

"Do you cure them, Christine? or do you only cover them up? If I had your creed nothing could
cure my wounds. Time might deaden the pain, and I forget them in other things, but I do not
see where any cure could come from. Oh, Christine! you did me good service when in the deepening
twilight of Miss Brown's parlor you showed me my useless, unbelieving life. But I do believe
now. The cross is radiant to me now--more radiant than the one that so startled us then. Mr.
Fleet's words were true, I know, as I know my own existence. I could die for my faith."

Christine frowned and said, almost harshly: "I don't believe in a religion so full of crosses
and death. Why could not the all-powerful Being you believe in take away the evil from the world?"

"That is just what He came to do. In that very character he was pointed out by His authorized
forerunner: 'Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.'"

"Why does he not do it then?" asked Christine, petulantly. "Centuries have passed. Patience
itself is wearied out. He has had time enough, if He ever meant or had the power to fulfil
the promise. But the world is as full of evil and suffering as ever. Susie, I would not disturb
your credulous faith, for it seems to do you good; but to me Christ was a noble but mistaken
man, dead and buried centuries ago. He can do for me no more than Socrates. They vigorously
attacked evil in their day, but evil was too much for them, as it is for us. We must just get
the most we can out of life, and endure what we cannot prevent or escape. An angel could not
convert me to-day--no, not even Susie Winthrop, and that is saying more still;" and with a
hasty kiss she vanished.

Susie looked wistfully after her, and then bent her steps homeward with a pitying face.

Christine at once went to her own private room. Putting on a loose wrapper she threw herself
on a lounge, and buried her face in the cushions. Her life seemed growing narrow and meagre.
Hour after hour passed, and the late afternoon sun was shining into her room when she arose
from her bitter revery, and summed up all in a few words spoken aloud, as was her custom when
alone.

"Must I, after all, come down to the Epicurean philosophy, 'Let us eat, drink, and be merry,
for to-morrow we die'? I seem on a narrow island, the ocean is all around me, and the tide
is rising, rising. It will cover soon my standing-place, and then what becomes of Christine
Ludolph?"

A look of anguish came into the fair young face, and a slight shudder passed over her. She
glanced around a room furnished in costly elegance. She saw her lovely person in the mirror
opposite, and exclaimed: "What a mystery it all is!  I have so much, and yet so utterly fail
of having that which contents. I have all that wealth can purchase; and multitudes act as if
that were enough. I know I am beautiful. I can see that yonder for myself, as well as read
it in admiring eyes. And yet my maid is better contented than I, and the boy who blacks the
boots better satisfied with his lot than either of us. I am raised so high that I can see how
much more there is or might be beyond. I feel like one led into a splendid vestibule, only
to find that the palace is wanting, or that it is a mean hovel. All that I have only mocks
me, and becomes a means of torture.  All that I am and have ought to be, might be, a mere prelude,
an earnest and a preparation for something better beyond.  But I am told, and must believe,
that this is all, and I may lose this in a moment and forever.  It is as if a noble strain
of music commenced sweetly, and then suddenly broken down into a few discordant notes and ceased.
It is like my picture--all very well; but that which would speak to and move the heart, year
after year, when the mere beauty ceased to please--that life or something is wanting. What
were his words?--'This picture is but the beautiful corpse of the other'; and my life is but
a cold marble effigy of a true life. And yet is there any true and better life?  If there is
nothing better beyond, I have been carried forward too far.  Miss Brown thoroughly enjoys champagne
and flirtations.  Susie Winthrop is happy in her superstition, as any one might be who could
believe what she does. But I have gone past the power of taking up these things, as I have
gone past my childhood's sports. And now what is there for me? My most dear and cherished hope--a
hope that shone above my life like a sun--has been blown away by the breath of my father's
clerk (it required no greater power to bring me down to my true level), and I hoped to be a
queen among men, high-born, but crowned with the richer coronet of genius. I, who hoped to
win so high a place that men would speak of me with honest praise, now and in all future time,
must be contented as a mere accomplished woman, deemed worthy perhaps in time to grace some
nobleman's halls who in the nice social scale abroad may stand a little higher than myself.
I meant to shine and dazzle, to stoop to give in every case; but now I must take what I can
get, with a humble 'Thank you';" and she clenched her little powerless hands in impotent revolt
at what seemed very cruel destiny.

She appeared at the dinner-table outwardly calm and quiet. Her father did not share in her
bitter disappointment, and she saw that he did not, and so felt more alone. He regarded her
success as remarkable (as it truly was), having never believed that she could copy a picture
so exactly as to deceive an ordinarily good observer. When, therefore, old Schwartz and others
were unable to distinguish between the pictures, he was more than satisfied. He was sorry that
Dennis had spoiled the triumph, but could not blame him. At the same time he recognized in
Fleet another and most decided proof of intelligence on questions of art, for he knew that
his criticism was just. He believed that when the true knight that his ambition would choose
appeared, with golden spurs and jewelled crest, then her deeper nature would awaken, and she
far surpass all previous effort. Moreover, he did not fully understand or enter into her lofty
ambition. To see her settled in life, titled, rich, and a recognized leader in the aristocracy
of his own land, was his highest aspiration so far as she was concerned.

He began, therefore, in a strain of compliment to cheer his daughter and rally her courage;
but she shook her head sadly, and said so decidedly, "Father, let us change the subject," that
with some surprise at her feelings he yielded to her wish, thinking that a little time and
experience would moderate her ideas and banish the pain of disappointment. It was a quiet meal,
both being occupied by their own thoughts. Soon after he was absorbed for the evening by his
cigar and some business papers.

It was a mild, summer-like night, and a warm, gentle rain was falling. Even in the midst of
a great city the sweet odors of spring found their way to the private parlor where Christine
sat by the window, still lost in painful thoughts.

"Nature is full of hope, and the promise of coming life. So ought I to be in this my spring-time.
Why am I not? If I am sad and disappointed in my spring, how dreary will be my autumn, when
leaf after leaf of beauty, health, and strength drops away!"

A muffled figure, seemingly regardless of the rain, passed slowly down the opposite side of
the street. Though the person cast but a single quick glance toward her window, and though
the twilight was deepening, something in the passer-by suggested Dennis Fleet. For a moment
she wished she could speak to him. She felt very lonely. Solitude had done her no good. Her
troubles only grew darker and more real as she brooded over them. She instinctively felt that
her father could not understand her, and she had never been able to go to him for sympathy.
He was not the kind of person that any one would seek for such a purpose. Christine was not
inclined to confidence, and there was really no one who knew her deeper feelings, and who could
enter into her real hopes for life. She was so proud and cold that few ever thought of giving
her confidence, much less of asking hers.

Up to the time of her recent illness she had been strong, self-confident, almost assured of
success. At times she recognized dimly that something was wrong; but she shut her eyes to the
unwelcome truth, and determined to succeed. But her sickness and fears at that time, and now
a failure that seemed to destroy the ambition of her life, all united in greatly shaking her
self-confidence.

This evening, as never before, she was conscious of weakness and dependence. With the instinct
of one sinking, her spirit longed for help and support. Then the thought suddenly occurred
to her, "Perhaps this young stranger, who so clearly pointed out the disease, may also show
the way to some remedy."

But the figure had passed on. In a moment mere pride and conventionality resumed sway, and
she smiled bitterly, saying to herself, "What a weak fool I am to-night! Of all things let
me not become a romantic miss again."

She went to her piano and struck into a brilliant strain. For a few moments the music was of
a forced and defiant character, loud, gay, but with no real or rollicking mirth in it, and
it soon ceased. Then in a sharp contrast came a sad, weird German ballad, and this was real.
In its pathos her burdened heart found expression, and whoever listened then would not merely
have admired, but would have felt. One song followed another. All the pent-up feeling of the
day seemed to find natural flow in the plaintive minstrelsy of her own land.

Suddenly she ceased and went to her window. The muffled figure stood in the shadow of an angle
in the attitude of a listener. A moment later it vanished in the dusk toward the business part
of the city. The quick footsteps died away, and only the patter of the falling rain broke the
silence. Christine felt sure that it was Dennis. At first her feeling was one of pleasure.
His coming and evident interest took somewhat, she scarcely knew why, from her sense of loneliness.
Soon her pride awoke, however, and she said: "He has no business here to watch and listen.
I will show him that, with all his taste and intelligence, we have no ground in common on which
he can presume."

Her father had also listened to the music, and said to himself: "Christine is growing a little
sentimental. She takes this disappointment too much to heart. I must touch her pride with the
spur a little, and that will make her ice and steel in a moment. It is no slight task to keep
a girl's heart safe till you want to use it. I will wait till the practical daylight of to-morrow,
and then she shall look at the world through my eyes again."

CHAPTER XXIX

DENNIS'S LOVE PUT TO PRACTICAL USE

The day following his unlucky criticism of the pictures was one of great despondency to Dennis.
He had read in Christine's face that he had wounded her sorely; and, though she knew it to
be unintentional, would it not prejudice her mind against him, and snap the slender thread
by which he hoped to draw across the gulf between them the cord, and then the cable, that might
in time unite their lives?

In the evening his restless, troubled spirit drove him, in spite of the rain, to seek to be
at least nearer to her. He felt sure that in the dusk and wrapped in his greatcoat he would
not be noticed, but was mistaken, as we have seen. He was rewarded, for he heard her sing as
never before, as he did not believe she could sing. For the first time her rich, thoroughly
trained voice had the sweetness and power of feeling. To Dennis her song seemed like an appeal,
a cry for help, and his heart responded in the deepest sympathy. As he walked homeward he said
to himself: "She could be a true artist, perhaps a great one, for she can feel. She has a heart.
She has a taste and skill in touch that few can surpass. I can scarcely believe the beautiful
coloring and faultless lines of that picture are her work." He long for a chance to speak with
her and explain. He felt that he had so much to say, and in a thousand imaginary ways introduced
the subject of her painting. He hoped he might find her sketching in some of the rooms again.
He thought that he knew her better for having heard her sing, and that he could speak to her
quite frankly.

The next day she came to the store, but passed him without the slightest notice. He hoped she
had not seen him, and, as she passed out, so placed himself that she must see him, and secured
for his pains only a slight, cold inclination of the head.

"It is as I feared," he said, bitterly. "She detests me for having spoiled her triumph. She
is not just," he added, angrily. "She has no sense of justice, or she would not blame me. What
a mean-spirited craven I should have been had I shrunk away under her taunts yesterday. Well,
I can be proud too."

When she came in again he did not raise his eyes, and when she passed out he was in a distant
part of the store. Christine saw no tall muffled figure under her window again, though she
had the curiosity to look. That even this humble admirer, for whom she cared not a jot, should
show such independence rather nettled and annoyed her for a moment. But she paid no more heed
to him than to the other clerks.

But what was the merest jar to Christine's vanity cost Dennis a desperate struggle. It required
no effort on her part to pass him by without a glance. To him it was torture. In a few days
she ceased to think about him at all, and only remembered him in connection with her disappointment.
But she was restless, could settle down to no work, and had lost her zest in her old pleasures.
She tried to act as usual, for she saw her father's eye was on her. He had not much indulgence
for any one's weaknesses save his own, and often by a little cold satire would sting her to
the very quick. On the other hand, his admiration, openly expressed in a certain courtly gallantry,
nourished her pride but not her heart. Though she tried to keep up her usual routine, her manner
was forced before him and languid when alone. But he said, "All this will pass away like a
cold snap in spring, and the old zest will come again in a few days."

It did, but from a cause which he could not understand, and which his daughter with consummate
skill and care concealed. He thought it was only the old enthusiasm rallying after a sharp
frost of disappointment.

Dennis's pride gave way before her cool and unstudied indifference. It was clearly evident
to him that he had no hold upon her life whatever, and how to gain any he did not see. He became
more and more dejected.

"She must have a heart, or I could not love her so; but it is so incased in ice I fear I can
never reach it."

That something was wrong with Dennis any friend who cared for him at all might see. The Bruders
did, and, with the quick intuitions of woman, Mrs. Bruder half guessed the cause. Mr. Bruder,
seeing preoccupation and sometimes weary apathy in Dennis's face, would say, "Mr. Fleet is
not well."

Then, as even this slight notice of his different appearance seemed to give pain, Mr. Bruder
was patiently and kindly blind to his pupil's inattention.

Dennis faithfully kept up all his duties on Sunday as during the week; but all was now hard
work. Some little time after the unlucky morning which he could never think of without an expression
of pain, he went to his mission class as usual. He heard his boys recite their lessons, said
a few poor lame words in explanation, and then leaned his head listlessly and wearily on his
hand. He was startled by hearing a sweet voice say, "Well, Mr. Fleet, are you not going to
welcome a new laborer into your corner of the vineyard?"

With a deep flush he saw that Miss Winthrop was in charge of the class next to him, and that
he had been oblivious to her presence nearly an hour. He tried to apologize. But she interrupted
him, saying: "Mr. Fleet, you are not well. Any one can see that."

Then Dennis blushed as if he had a raging fever, and she was perplexed.

The closing exercises of the school now occupied them and then they walked out together.

"Mr. Fleet," she said, "you never accepted my invitation. We have not seen you at our house.
But perhaps your circle of friends is so large that you do not wish to add to it."

Dennis could not forbear a smile at the suggestion, but he said, in apology, "I do not visit
any one, save a gentleman from whom I am taking lessons."

"Do you mean to say that you have no friends at all in this great city?"

"Well, I suppose that is nearly the truth; that is, in the sense you use the term. My teacher
and his wife--"

"Nonsense! I mean friends of one's own age, people of the same culture and status as yourself.
I think we require such society, as truly as we need food and air. I did not mean those whom
business or duty brought you in contact with, or who are friendly or grateful as a matter of
course."

"I have made no progress since my introduction to society at Miss Brown's," said Dennis.

"But you had the sincere and cordial offer of introduction," said Miss Winthrop, looking a
little hurt.

"I feel hardly fit for society," said Dennis, all out of sorts with himself. "It seems that
I can only blunder and give pain. But I am indeed grateful for your kindness."

Miss Winthrop looked into his worn, pale face, and instinctively knew that something was wrong,
and she felt real sympathy for the lonely young man, isolated among thousands. She said, gently
but decidedly: "I did mean my invitation kindly, and I truly wished you to come. The only proof
you can give that you appreciate my courtesy is to accept an invitation for to-morrow evening.
I intend having a little musical entertainment."

Quick as light flashed the thought, "Christine will be there." He said, promptly: "I will come,
and thank you for the invitation. If I am awkward, you must remember that I have never mingled
in Chicago society, and for a long time not in any."

She smiled merrily at him, and said, "Don't do anything dreadful, Mr. Fleet."

He caught her mood, and asked what had brought her down from her theological peak to such a
valley of humiliation as a mission school.

"You and Miss Ludolph" she answered, seriously. "Between you, you gave me such a lesson that
afternoon at Miss Brown's that I have led a different life ever since. Christine made all as
dark as despair, and against that darkness you placed the fiery Cross. I have tried to cling
to the true cross ever since. Now He could not say to me, 'Inasmuch as ye did it not.' And
oh!" said she, turning to Dennis with a smile full of the light of Heaven, "His service is
so very sweet! I heard last week that teachers were wanted at this mission school, so I came,
and am glad to find you a neighbor."

Dennis's face also kindled at her enthusiasm, but after a moment grew sad again.

"I do not always give so lifeless a lesson as to-day," he said, in a low voice.

"Mr. Fleet, you are not well. I can see that you look worn and greatly wearied. Are you not
in some way overtaxing yourself?"

Again that sensitive flush, but he only said: "I assure you I am well. Perhaps I have worked
a little hard. That is all."

"Well, then, come to our house and play a little tomorrow evening," she answered from the platform
of a street car, and was borne away.

Dennis went to his lonely room, full of self-reproach.

"Does she find Christ's service so sweet, and do I find it so dull and hard? Does human love
alone constrain me, and not the love of Christ? Truly I am growing weak. Every one says I look
ill. I think I am, in body and soul, and am ceasing to be a man; but with God's help I will
be one--and what is more, a Christian. I thank you, Miss Winthrop; you have helped me more
than I have helped you. I will accept your invitation to go out into the world. I will no longer
mope, brood, and perish in the damp and shade of my own sick fancies. If I cannot win her,
I can at least be a man without her;" and he felt better and stronger than he had done for
a long time. The day was breaking again.

In accordance with a custom that was growing with him ever since the memorable evening when
Bill Cronk befriended him, he laid the whole matter before his Heavenly Father, as a child
tells an earthly parent all his heart. Then he added one simple prayer, "Guide me in all things."

The next day was brighter and better than its forerunners. "For some reason I feel more like
myself," he thought. After the excitement and activity of a busy day, he said, "I can conquer
this, if I must."

But when he had made his simple toilet, and was on his way to Miss Winthrop's residence, his
heart began to flutter strangely, and he knew the reason. Miss Winthrop welcomed him most cordially,
and put him at his ease in a moment, as only a true lady can. Then she turned to receive other
guests. He looked around. Christine was not there; and his heart sank like lead. "She will
not be here," he sighed. But the guests had not ceased coming, and every new arrival caused
a flutter of hopes and fears. He both longed and dreaded to meet her. At last, when he had
almost given up seeing her, suddenly she appeared, advancing up the parlor on her father's
arm. Never had she seemed so dazzlingly beautiful. He was just then talking to Mr. Winthrop,
and for a few moments that gentleman was perplexed at his incoherent answers and the changes
in his face. Having paid their respects to the daughter, Mr. and Miss Ludolph came toward Mr.
Winthrop, and of course Dennis had to meet them. Having greeted them warmly, Mr. Winthrop said,
"Of course you do not need an introduction to Mr. Fleet."

Dennis had shrunk a little into the background, and at first they had not noticed him. Mr.
Ludolph said, good-naturedly, "Glad to see you, Mr. Fleet, and will be still more glad to hear
your fine voice."

But Christine merely bowed as to one with whom her acquaintance was slight, and turned away.
At first Dennis had blushed, and his heart had fluttered like a young girl's; but, as she turned
so coolly away, his native pride and obstinacy were aroused.

"She shall speak to me and do me justice," he muttered. "She must understand that I spoke unconsciously
on that miserable morning, and am not to be blamed. As I am a man, I will speak boldly and
secure recognition." But as the little company mingled and conversed before the music commenced,
no opportunity offered. He determined to show her, however, that he was no country boor, and
with skill and taste made himself agreeable.

Christine furtively watched him. She was surprised to see him, as the idea of meeting him in
society as an equal had scarcely been suggested before. But when she saw that he greeted one
after another with grace and ease, and that all seemed to enjoy his conversation, so that a
little knot of Miss Winthrop's most intelligent guests were about him at last, she felt that
it would be no great condescension on her part to be a little more affable. In her heart, though,
she had not forgiven the unconscious words that had smitten to the ground her ambitious hopes.

Then again, his appearance deeply interested her. A suppressed excitement and power, seen in
the glow and fire of his dark eyes, and felt in his tones, stirred her languid pulses.

"He is no vapid society-man," she said to herself; and her artist eye was gratified by the
changes in his noble face.

"Look at Fleet," whispered her father; "could you believe he was sweeping the store the other
day? Well, if we don't find out his worth and get what we can from him, the world will. We
ought to have had him up to sing before this, but I have been so busy since your illness that
it slipped my mind."

Miss Winthrop now led Christine to the piano, and she played a classical piece of music in
faultless taste. Then followed duets, solos, quartets, choruses, and instrumental pieces, for
nearly all present were musical amateurs. Under the inspiration of this soul-stirring art,
coldness and formality melted away, and with jest and brilliant repartee, alternating with
song, there gathered around Miss Winthrop's piano such a group as could never grace the parlors
of Miss Brown. Sometimes they would carry a new and difficult piece triumphantly through; again
they would break down, with much laughter and good-natured rallying.

Dennis, as a stranger, held back at first; but those who remembered his singing at the tableau
party were clamorous to hear him again, and they tested and tried his voice during the evening
in many and varied ways. But he held his own, and won greener laurels than ever. He did his
very best, for he was before one whom he would rather please than all the world; moreover,
her presence seemed to inspire him to do better than when alone. Christine, like the others,
could not help listening with delight to his rich, clear tenor, and Mr. Ludolph was undisguised
in his admiration.

"I declare, Mr. Fleet, I have been depriving myself of a good deal of pleasure. I meant to
have you up to sing with us before, but we have been under such a press of business of late!
But the first evening I am disengaged you must surely come."

Christine had noticed how quietly and almost indifferently Dennis had taken the many compliments
showered on him before, but now, when her father spoke, his face flushed, and a sudden light
came into his eyes. Dennis had thought, "I can then see and speak to her." Every now and then
she caught his eager, questioning, and almost appealing glance, but he made no advances. "He
thinks I am angry because of his keen criticism of my picture. For the sake of my own pride,
I must not let him think that I care so much about his opinion;" and Christine resolved to
let some of the ice thaw that had formed between them. Moreover, in spite of herself, when
she was thrown into his society, he greatly interested her. He seemed to have just what she
had not. He could meet her on her own ground in matters of taste, and then, in contrast with
her cold, negative life, he was so earnest and positive. "Perhaps papa spoke for us both,"
she thought, "and I have been depriving myself of a pleasure also, for he certainly interests
while most men only weary me."

Between ten and eleven supper was announced; not the prodigal abundance under which the brewer's
table had groaned, but a dainty, elegant little affair, which inspired and promoted social
feeling, though the "spirit of wine" was absent. The eye was feasted as truly as the palate.
Christine had stood near Dennis as the last piece was sung, and he turned and said in a low,
eager tone, "May I have the pleasure of waiting on you at supper?"

She hesitated, but his look was so wistful that she could not well refuse, so with a slight
smile she bowed assent, and placed the tips of her little gloved hand on his arm, which so
trembled that she looked inquiringly and curiously into his face. It was very pale, as was
ever the case when he felt deeply. He waited on her politely but silently at first. She sat
in an angle, somewhat apart from the others. As he stood by her side, thinking how to refer
to the morning in the show-room, she said: "Mr. Fleet, you are not eating anything, and you
look as if you had been living on air of late--very unlike your appearance when you so efficiently
aided me in the rearrangement of the store. I am delighted that you keep up the better order
of things." Dennis's answer was quite irrelevant.

"Miss Ludolph," he said, abruptly, "I saw that I gave you pain that morning in the show-room.
If you only knew how the thought has pained me!"

Christine flushed almost angrily, but said, coldly, "Mr. Fleet, that is a matter you can never
understand, therefore we had better dismiss the subject."

But Dennis had determined to break the ice between them at any risk, so he said, firmly but
respectfully: "Miss Ludolph, I did understand all, the moment I saw your face that day. I do
understand how you have felt since, better than you imagine."

His manner and words were so assured that she raised a startled face to his, but asked coldly
and in an indifferent manner, "What can you know of my feelings?"

"I know," said Dennis, in a low tone, looking searchingly into her face, from which cool composure
was fast fading--"I know your dearest hope was to be among the first in art. You staked that
hope on your success in a painting that required a power which you do not possess." Christine
became very pale, but from her eyes shone a light before which most men would have quailed.
But Dennis's love was so true and strong that he could wound her for the sake of the healing
and life he hoped to bring, and he continued--"On that morning this cherished hope for the
future failed you, not because of my words, but because your artist eye saw that my words were
true. You have since been unhappy--"

"What right have you--you who were but a few days since--who are a stranger--what right have
you to speak thus to me?"

"I know what you would say, Miss Ludolph," he answered, a slight flush coming into his pale
face. "Friends may be humble and yet true. But am I not right?"

"I have no claim on your friendship," said Christine, coldly. "But, for the sake of argument,
grant that you are right, what follows?" and she looked at him more eagerly than she knew.
She felt that he had read her very soul and was deeply moved, and again the superstitious feeling
crept over her, "That young man is in some way connected with my destiny."

Dennis saw his power and proceeded rapidly, for he knew they might be interrupted at any moment;
and so they would have been had anything less interesting than eating occupied the attention
of others.

"I saw in the picture what in your eyes and mine would be a fatal defect--the lack of life
and true feeling--the lack of power to live. I did not know who painted it, but felt that any
one who could paint as well as that, and yet leave out the soul, as it were, had not the power
to put it in. No artist of such ability could willingly or ignorantly have permitted such a
defect."

Christine's eyes sank, their fire faded out, and her face had the pallor of one listening to
her doom. This deeper feeling mastered the momentary resentment against the hand that was wounding
her, and she forgot him, and all, in her pain and despair.

In a low, earnest tone Dennis continued: "But since I have come to know who the artist is,
since I have studied the picture more fully, and have taken the liberty of some observation"--Christine
hung on his lips breathlessly, and Dennis spoke slowly, marking the effect of every word--"I
have come to the decided belief that the lady who painted that picture can reach the sphere
of true and highest art."

The light that stole into Christine's face under his slow, emphatic words was like a rosy dawn
in June; and the thought flashed through Dennis's mind, "If an earthly hope can so light up
her face, what will be the effect of a heavenly one?"

For a moment she sat as one entranced, looking at a picture far off in the future. His words
had been so earnest and assured that they seemed reality. Suddenly she turned on him a look
as grateful and happy as the former one had been full of pain and anger, and said: "Ah, do
not deceive me, do not flatter. You cannot know the sweetness and power of the hope you are
inspiring. To be disappointed again would be death. If you are trifling with me I will never
forgive you," she added, in sudden harshness, her brow darkening.

"Nor should I deserve to be forgiven if I deceived you in a matter that to you is so sacred."

"But how--how am I to gain this magic power to make faces feel and live on canvas?"

"You must believe. You yourself must feel."

She looked at him with darkening face, and then in a sudden burst of passion said: "I don't
believe; I can't feel. All this is mockery, after all."

"No!" said Dennis, in the deep, assured tone that ever calms and secures attention. "This is
not mockery. I speak the words of truth and soberness. You do not believe, but that is not
the same as cannot. And permit me to contradict you when I say you do feel. On this subject
so near your heart you feel most deeply--feel as I never knew any one feel before. This proves
you capable of feeling on other and higher subjects, and what you feel your trained and skilful
hand can portray. You felt on the evening of that miserable day, and sang as I never heard
you sing before. Your tones then would move any heart, and my tears fell with the rain in sympathy:
I could not help it."

Her bosom rose and fell tumultuously, and her breath came hard and quick.

"Oh, if I could believe you were right!"

"I know I am right," he said, so decidedly that again hope grew rosy and beautiful in her face.

"Then again," he continued, eagerly, "see what an advantage you have over the most of us. Your
power of imitation is wonderful. You can copy anything you see."

"Good-evening, Miss Ludolph. Where have you been hiding? I have twice made the tour of the
supper-room in my search," broke in the voluble Mr. Mellen. Then he gave Dennis a cool stare,
who acted as if unconscious of his presence. An expression of disgust flitted across Christine's
face at the interruption, or the person--perhaps both-- and she was about to shake him off
that Dennis might speak further, when Miss Winthrop and others came up, and there was a general
movement back to the parlors.

"Why, Christine, what is the matter?" asked her friend. "You look as if you had a fever. What
has Mr. Fleet been saying?"

"Oh, we have had an argument on my hobby, art, and of course don't agree, and so got excited
in debate."

Miss Winthrop glanced keenly at them and said, "I would like to have heard it, for it was Greek
meeting Greek."

"To what art or trade did Mr. Fleet refer?" asked Mr. Mellen, with an insinuation that all
understood.

"One that you do not understand," said Christine, keenly.

The petted and spoiled millionaire flushed angrily a moment, and then said with a bow: "You
are right, Miss Ludolph. Mr. Fleet is acquainted with one or two arts that I have never had
the pleasure of learning."

"He has at least learned the art of being a gentleman," was the sharp retort.

The young man's face grew darker, and he said, "From the sweeping nature of your remarks, I
perceive that Mr. Fleet is high in your favor."

"A poor pun made in poorer taste," was all the comfort he got from Christine.

Dennis was naturally of a very jealous disposition where his affections were concerned. His
own love took such entire possession of him that he could not brook the interference of others,
or sensibly consider that they had the same privilege to woo, and win if possible, that he
had. Especially distasteful to him was this rich and favored youth, whose presence awakened
all his combativeness, which was by no means small.

Mr. Mellen's most inopportune interruption and covert taunts provoked him beyond endurance.
His face was fairly white with rage, and for a moment he felt that he could stamp his rival
out of existence. In the low, concentrated voice of passion he said, "If Mr. Mellen should
lose his property, as many do, I gather from his remarks that he would still keep up his idea
of a gentleman on charity."

Mr. Mellen flushed to the roots of his hair, his hands clenched. In the flashing eyes and threatening
faces of the young men those witnessing the scene foresaw trouble. A light hand fell on Dennis's
arm, and Miss Winthrop said, "Mr. Fleet, I wish to show you a picture, and ask your judgment
in regard to it."

Dennis understood the act, and in a moment more his face was crimson with shame.

"Miss Winthrop, you ought to send me home at once. I told you I was unfit for society. Somehow
I am not myself. I humbly ask your pardon."

"So sincere a penitent shall receive absolution at once. You were greatly provoked. I trust
you for the future."

"You may," was the emphatic answer. After that pledge Mr. Mellen might have struck him and
received no more response than from a marble statue.

Mr. Mellen also took a sober second thought, remembering that he was in a lady's parlor. He
walked away with his ears tingling, for the flattered youth had never had such an experience
before. The few who witnessed the scene smiled significantly, as did Christine half contemptuously;
but Miss Winthrop soon restored serenity, and the remaining hours passed away in music and
dancing. Christine did not speak to Dennis again--that is, by word of mouth--but she thought
of him constantly, and their eyes often met;--on his part that same eager, questioning look.
She ever turned hers at once away. But his words kept repeating themselves continually, especially
his last sentence, when the unlucky Mr. Mellen had broken in upon them--"You can copy anything
you see."

"How noble and expressive of varied feeling his face is!" she thought, watching it change under
the playful badinage of Miss Winthrop.

"How I would like to copy it! Well, you can--'You can copy anything you see.'" Then like a
flash came a suggestion--"You can make him love you, and copy feeling, passion, life--from
the living face. Whether I can believe or feel, myself, is very doubtful. This I can do: he
himself said so. I cannot love, myself--I must not; I do not wish to now, but perhaps I can
inspire love in him, and then make his face a study. As to my believing, he can never know
how utterly impossible his faith is to me."

Then conscience entered a mild protest against the cruelty of the project. "Nonsense!" she
said to herself; "most girls flirt for sport, and it is a pity if I cannot with such a purpose
in view. He will soon get over a little puncture in his heart after I have sailed away to my
bright future beyond the sea, and perhaps Susie will comfort him;" and she smiled at the thought.
Dennis saw the smile and was entranced by its loveliness. How little he guessed the cause!

Having resolved, Christine acted promptly. When their eyes again met, she gave him a slight
smile. He caught it instantly and looked bewildered, as if he could not believe his eyes. Again,
when a little later, at the urgent request of many, he sang alone for the first time, and again
moved his hearers deeply by the real feeling in his tones, he turned from the applause of all,
with that same questioning look, to her. She smiled an encouragement that she had never given
him before. The warm blood flooded his face instantly. All thought that it was the general
chorus of praise. Christine knew that she had caused it, and surprise and almost exultation
came into her face. "I half believe he loves me now," she said. She threw him a few more kindly
smiles from time to time, as one might throw some glittering things to an eager child, and
every moment assured her of her power.

"I will try one more test," she said, and by a little effort she lured to her side the offended
Mr. Mellen, and appeared much pleased by his attention. Then unmistakably the pain of jealousy
was stamped on Dennis's face, and she was satisfied. Shaking off the perplexed Mr. Mellen again,
she went to the recess of a window to hide her look of exultation.

"The poor victim loves me already," she said. "The mischief is done. I have only to avail myself
of what exists from no fault of mine, and surely I ought to; otherwise the passion of the infatuated
youth will be utterly wasted, and do no one any good."

Thus in a somewhat novel way Christine obtained a new master in painting, and poor Dennis and
his love were put to use somewhat as a human subject might be if dissected alive.

CHAPTER XXX

THE TWO HEIGHTS

Dennis went home in a strange tumult of hopes and fears, but hope predominated, for evidently
she cared little for Mr. Mellen. "The ice is broken at last," he said. It was, but he was like
to fall through into a very cold bath, though he knew it not. He was far too excited to sleep,
and sat by his open window till the warm June night grew pale with the light of coming day.

Suddenly a bright thought struck him; a moment more and it became an earnest purpose. "I think
I can paint something that may express to her what I dare not put in words."

He immediately went up into the loft and prepared a large frame, so proportioned that two pictures
could be painted side by side, one explanatory and an advance upon the other. He stretched
his canvas over this, and sketched and outlined rapidly under the inspiration of his happy thought.

Christine came with her father to the store, as had been her former custom, and her face had
its old expression. The listless, disappointed look was gone. She passed on, not appearing
to see him while with her father, and Dennis's heart sank again. "She surely knew where to
look for me if she cared to look," he said to himself. Soon after he went to the upper show-room
to see to the hanging of a new picture.

"I am so glad your taste, instead of old Schwartz's mathematics, has charge of this department
now," said a honeyed voice at his side. He was startled greatly.

"What is the matter? Are you nervous, Mr. Fleet? I had no idea that a lady could so frighten you."

He was blushing like a girl, but said, "I have read that something within, rather than anything
without, makes us cowards."

"Ah, then you confess to a guilty conscience?" she replied, with a twinkle in her eye.

"I do not think I shall confess at all till I have a merciful confessor," said Dennis, conscious
of a deeper meaning than his light words might convey.

"'The quality of mercy is not strained,' therefore it is unfit for my use. I'll none of it,
but for each offence impose unlimited penance."

"But suppose one must sin?"

"He must take the consequences then. Even your humane religion teaches that;" and with this
parting arrow she vanished, leaving him too excited to hang his picture straight.

It all seemed a bewildering dream. Being so thoroughly taken by surprise and off his guard,
he had said far more than he meant. But had she understood him? Yes, better than he had himself,
and laughed at his answers with their covert meanings.

She spent the next two days in sketching and outlining his various expressions as far as possible
from memory. She would learn to catch those evanescent lines--that something which makes the
human face eloquent, though the lips are silent.

Dennis was in a maze, but he repeated to himself jubilantly again, "The ice is broken." That
evening at Mr. Bruder's he asked for studies in ice.

"Vy, dat is out of season," said Mr. Bruder, with a laugh.

"No, now is just the time. It is a nice cool subject for this hot weather. Please oblige me;
for certain reasons I wish to be able to paint ice perfectly."

Arctic scenery was Mr. Bruder's forte, on which he specially prided himself. He was too much
of a gentleman to ask questions, and was delighted to find the old zest returning in his pupil.
They were soon constructing bergs, caves, and grottoes of cold blue ice. Evening after evening,
while sufficient light lasted, they worked at this study. Dennis's whole soul seemed bent on
the formation of ice. After a month of labor Mr. Bruder said, "I hope you vill get over dis
by fall, or ve all freeze to death."

"One of these days I shall explain," said Dennis, smiling.

The evening of the second day after the little rencounter in the show-room, Mr. Ludolph sat
enjoying his cigar, and Christine was at the piano playing a difficult piece of music.

"Come, father," she said, "here is a fine thing just from Germany. There is a splendid tenor
solo in it, and I want you to sing it for me."

"Pshaw!" said her father, "why did I not think of it before?" and he rang the bell. "Here,
Brandt, go down to the store, and if Mr. Fleet is there ask him if he will come up to my rooms
for a little while."

Brandt met Dennis just starting for his painting lesson, but led him a willing captive, to
give Christine instruction unconsciously.

She, whose strategy had brought it all about, smiled at her success. It was not her father's
tenor she wanted, but Dennis's face; and her father should unknowingly work her will. The girl
had learned so much from the wily man of the world that she was becoming his master.

Dennis came and entered with a thrill of delight what was to him enchanted ground. Mr. Ludolph
was affable, Christine kind, but she looked more than she said.

Dennis sang the solo, after one or two efforts, correctly. Then Mr. Ludolph brought out a piece
of music that he wished to try; Christine found others; and before they knew it the evening
had passed. Quite a knot of delighted listeners gathered in the street opposite. This Christine
pointed out to her father with evident annoyance.

"Well, my dear," he said, "hotel life in a crowded city renders escape from such things impossible."

But a purpose was growing in her mind of which she spoke soon after. Throughout the evening
she had studied Dennis's face as much as she could without attracting notice, and the thought
grew upon her that at last she had found a path to the success she so craved.

"You seem to have gone to work with your old interest," said her father, as he came out of
his room the next morning and found Christine at her easel.

"I shall try it again," she said, briefly.

"That is right," said he. "The idea of being daunted by one partial failure! I predict for
you such success as will satisfy even your fastidious taste."

"We shall see," she said. "I hope, too." But she would not have her father know on what grounds.
He might regard the experiment as a dangerous one for herself as well as for Dennis, and she
decided to keep her plan entirely secret.

She now came to the store daily, and rarely went away without giving Dennis a smile or word
of recognition. But he noticed that she ever did this in a casual manner, and in a way that
would not attract attention. He also took the hint, and never was obtrusive or demonstrative,
but it was harder work for his frank nature. When unobserved, his glances grew more ardent
day by day. So far from checking these, she encouraged them, but, when in any way he sought
to put his feelings into words, she changed the subject instantly and decidedly. This puzzled
him, for he did not understand that looks could be painted, but not words. The latter were
of no use to her. But she led him on skilfully, and, from the unbounded power his love gave
her, played upon his feelings as adroitly as she touched her grand piano.

Soon after the company at Miss Winthrop's, she said to him, "You received several invitations
the other evening, did you not?"

"Yes."

"Accept them. Go into society. It will do you good." Thus he soon found himself involved in
a round of sociables, musicales, and now and then a large party. Christine was usually present,
radiant, brilliant, the cynosure of all eyes, but ever coolly self-possessed. At first she
would greet him with distant politeness, or pretend not to see him at all, but before the evening
was over would manage to give him a half-hour in which she would be kind and even gentle at
times, but very observant. Then for the rest of the evening he would find no chance to approach.
It appeared that she was deeply interested in him, enjoyed his society, and was even becoming
attached to him, but that for some reason she determined that no one should notice this, and
that matters should only go so far. Poor Dennis could not know that he was only her unconscious
instructor in painting, paid solely in the coin of false smiles and delusive hopes. At times,
though, she would torture him dreadfully. Selecting one of her many admirers, she would seem
to smile upon his suit, and poor Dennis would writhe in all the agonies of jealousy, for he
was very human, and had all the normal feeling of a strong man. She would then watch his face
grow pale and his manner restless, as quietly and critically as an entomologist regards the
struggles of an insect beneath his microscope. Again, she would come to him all grace and sweetness,
and his fine face would light up with hope and pleasure. She would say honeyed nothings, but
study him just as coolly in another aspect.

Thus she kept him hot and cold by turns--now lifting him to the pinnacle of hope, again casting
him down into the valley of fear and doubt. What she wanted of him was just what she had not--feeling,
intense, varied feeling, so that, while she remained ice, she could paint as if she felt; and
with a gifted woman's tact, and with the power of one loved almost to idolatry, she caused
every chord of his soul, now in happy harmony, now in painful discord, to vibrate under her
skilful touch. But such a life was very wearing, and he was failing under it. Moreover, he
was robbing himself of sleep in the early morning, that he might work on his picture in the
loft of the store, for which he asked of poor Mr. Bruder nothing but ice.

Mrs. Bruder worried over him continually.

"You vork too hart. Vat shall we do for you? Oh, my fren, if you love us do not vork so hart,"
she would often say. But Dennis would only smile and turn to her husband in his insatiable
demand for painted ice. At last Mr. Bruder said, "Mr. Fleet, you can paint ice, as far as I
see, as veil as myself."

Then Dennis turned around short and said, "Now I want warm rosy light and foliage; give me
studies in these."

"By de hammer of Thor, but you go to extremes."

"You shall know all some day," said Dennis, entering on his new tasks with increasing eagerness.

But day by day he grew thinner and paler. Even Christine's heart sometimes relented; for, absorbed
as she was in her own work and interests, she could not help noticing how sadly he differed
from the vigorous youth who had lifted the heavy pictures for her but a few short weeks ago.
But she quieted herself by the thought that he was a better artistic subject, and that he would
mend again when the cool weather came.

"Where shall we go for the two hot months?" asked her father the morning after the Fourth.

"I have a plan to propose," replied Christine. "Suppose we go to housekeeping."

"What!" said her father, dropping his knife and fork, and looking at her in astonishment. "Go
to all the expense of furnishing a house, when we do not expect to stay here much more than
a year? We should hardly be settled before we left it."

"Listen to me patiently till I finish, and then I will abide by your decision. But I think
you will give me credit for having a slight turn for business as well as art. You remember
Mr. Jones's beautiful house on the north side, do you not? It stands on ---- Street, well back,
surrounded by a lawn and flowers. There is only one other house on the block. Well, Mr. Jones
is embarrassed, and his house is for sale. From inquiry I am satisfied that a cash offer would
obtain the property cheaply. The furniture is good, and much of it elegant. What we do not
want--what will not accord with a tasteful refurnishing--can be sent to an auction-room. At
comparatively slight expense, if you can spare Mr. Fleet to help me during the time when business
is dull, I can make the house such a gem of artistic elegance that it will be noted throughout
the city, and next fall some rich snob, seeking to vault suddenly into social position, will
give just what you are pleased to ask. In the meantime we have a retired and delightful home.

"Moreover, father," she continued, touching him on his weak side, "it will be a good preparation
for the more difficult and important work of the same kind awaiting me in my own land."

"Humph!" said Mr. Ludolph, meditatively, "there is more method in your madness than I imagined.
I will think of it, for it is too important a step to be taken hastily."

Mr. Ludolph did think of it, and, after attending to pressing matters in the store, went over
to see the property. A few days afterward he came up to dinner and threw the deed for it into
his daughter's lap. She glanced it over, and her eyes grew luminous with delight and triumph.

"See how comfortable and happy I will make you in return for this kindness," she said.

"Oh, come," replied her father, laughing, "that is not the point. This is a speculation, and
your business reputation is at stake."

"I will abide the test," she answered, with a significant nod.

Christine desired the change for several reasons. There was a room in the house that would
just suit her as a studio. She detested the publicity of a hotel. The furnishing of an elegant
house was a form of activity most pleasing to her energetic nature, and she felt a very strong
wish to try her skill in varied effect before her grand effort in the Ludolph Hall of the future.

But in addition to these motives was another, of which she did not speak to her father. In
the privacy of her own home she could pursue that peculiar phase of art study in which she
was absorbed. Her life had now become a most exciting one. She ever seemed on the point of
obtaining the power to portray the eloquence of passion, feeling, but there was a subtile something
that still eluded her. She saw it daily, and yet could not reproduce it. She seemed to get
the features right, and yet they were dead, or else the emotion was so exaggerated as to suggest
weak sentimentality, and this of all things disgusted her. Every day she studied the expressive
face of Dennis Fleet, the mysterious power seemed nearer her grasp. Her effort was now gaining
all the excitement of a chase. She saw before her just what she wanted, and it seemed that
she had only to grasp her pencil or brush, and place the fleeting expressions where they might
always appeal to the sympathy of the beholder. Nearly all her studies now were the human face
and form, mainly those of ladies, to disarm suspicion. Of course she took no distinct likeness
of Dennis. She sought only to paint what his face expressed. At times she seemed about to succeed,
and excitement brought color to her cheek and fire to her eye that made her dazzlingly beautiful
to poor Dennis. Then she would smile upon him in such a bewitching, encouraging way that it
was little wonder his face lighted up with all the glory of hope.

If once more she could have him about her as when rearranging the store, and, without the restraint
of curious eyes, could play upon his heart, then pass at once to her easel with the vivid impression
of what she saw, she might catch the coveted power, and become able to portray, as if she felt,
that which is the inspiration of all the highest forms of art--feeling.

That evening, Dennis, at Mr. Ludolph's request, came to the hotel to try some new music. During
the evening Mr. Ludolph was called out for a little time. Availing himself of the opportunity,
Dennis said, "You seem to be working with all your old zest and hope."

"Yes," she said, "with greater hope than ever before."

"Won't you show me something that you are doing?"

"No, not yet. I am determined that when you see work of mine again the fatal defect which you
pointed out shall be absent."

His eyes and face became eloquent with the hope she inspired. Was her heart, awakening from
its long winter of doubt and indifference, teaching her to paint? Had she recognized the truth
of his assurance that she must feel, and then she could portray feeling? and had she read in
his face and manner that which had created a kindred impulse in her heart? He was about to
speak, the ice of his reserve and prudence fast melting under what seemed good evidence that
her smiles and kindness might be interpreted in accordance with his longings. She saw and anticipated.

"With all your cleverness, Mr. Fleet, I may prove you at fault, and become able to portray
what I do not feel or believe."

"You mean to say that you work from your old standpoint merely?" asked Dennis, feeling as if
a sunny sky had suddenly darkened.

"I do not say that at all, but that I do not work from yours."

"And yet you hope to succeed?" "I think I am succeeding."

Perplexity and disappointment were plainly written on his face. She, with a merry and half-malicious
laugh, turned to the piano, and sung:

    From Mount Olympus' snowy height
    The gods look down on human life:
    Beneath contending armies fight;
    All undisturbed they watch the strife.

Dennis looked at her earnestly, and after a moment said, "Will you please play that accompaniment
again?"

She complied, and he sang:

    Your Mount Olympus' icy peak
    Is barren waste, by cold winds swept:
    Another height I gladly see,
    Where God o'er human sorrow wept.

She turned a startled and almost wistful face to him, for he had given a very unexpected answer
to her cold, selfish philosophy, which was so apt and sudden as to seem almost inspired.

"Do you refer to Christ's weeping over Jerusalem?" she asked.

"Yes."

She sat for a little time silent and thoughtful, and Dennis watched her keenly. Suddenly her
brow darkened, and she said, bitterly: "Delusion! If He had been a God He would not have idly
wept over sorrow. He would have banished it."

Dennis was about to reply eagerly, when Mr. Ludolph entered, and music was resumed. But it
was evident that Dennis's lines had disturbed the fair sceptic's equanimity.

CHAPTER XXXI

BEGUILED

Dennis returned to his room greatly perplexed. There was something in Christine's actions which
he could not understand. From the time of their first conversation at Miss Winthrop's, she
had evidently felt and acted differently. If her heart remained cold and untouched, if as yet
neither faith nor love had any existence therein, what was the inspiring motive? Why should
deep discouragement change suddenly to assured hope?

Then again her manner was equally inexplicable. From that same evening she gave him more encouragement
than he had even hoped to receive for months, but yet he made no progress. She seemed to enjoy
meeting him, and constantly found opportunity to do so. Her eyes were continually seeking his
face, but there was something in her manner in this respect that puzzled him more than anything
else. She often seemed looking at his face, rather than at him. At first Christine had been
furtive and careful in her observations, but as the habit grew upon her, and her interest increased,
she would sometimes gaze so steadily that poor Dennis was deeply embarrassed. Becoming conscious
of this, she would herself color slightly, and be more careful for a time.

In her eagerness for success, Christine did not realize how dangerous an experiment she was
trying. She could not look upon such a face as Dennis Fleet's, eloquent with that which should
never fail to touch a woman's heart with sympathy, and then forget it when she chose. Moreover,
though she knew it not, in addition to her interest in him as an art study, his strong, positive
nature affected her cool, negative one most pleasantly. His earnest manifested feeling fell
like sunlight on a heart benumbed with cold.

Thus, under the stimulus of his presence, she found that she could paint or sketch to much
better purpose than when alone. This knowledge made her rejoice in secret over the opportunity
she could now have, as Dennis again assisted her in hanging pictures, and affixing to the walls
ornaments of various kinds.

Coming to him one morning in the store, she said, "I am going to ask a favor of you again."

Dennis looked as if she were conferring the greatest of favors. His face always lighted up
when she spoke to him.

"It is very kind of you to ask so pleasantly for what you can command," he said.

"To something of the same effect you answered before, and the result was the disagreeable experience
at Miss Brown's."

Dennis's brow contracted a little, but he said, heroically, "I will go to Miss Brown's again
if you wish it."

"How self-sacrificing you are!" she replied, with a half-mischievous smile.

"Not as much so as you imagine," he answered, flushing slightly.

"Well, set your mind at rest on that score. Though not very merciful, as you know, I would
put no poor soul through that ordeal again. In this case you will only have to encounter one
of the tormentors you met on that occasion, and I will try to vouch for her better behavior."
Then she added, seriously: "I hope you will not think the task beneath you. You do not seem
to have much of the foolish pride that stands in the way of so many Americans, and then"--looking
at him with a pleading face--"I have so set my heart upon it, and it would be such a disappointment
if you were unwilling!"

"You need waste no more ammunition on one ready to surrender at discretion," he said.

"Very well; then I shall treat you with all the rigors of a prisoner of war. I shall carry
you away captive to my new castle on the north side and put you at your old menial task of
hanging pictures and decorating in various ways. As eastern sovereigns built their palaces
and adorned their cities by the labors of those whom the fortunes of war threw into their hands,
so your skill and taste shall be useful to me; and I, your head task-mistress," she added,
with her insinuating smile, "will be ever present to see that there is no idling, nothing but
monotonous toil. Had you not better have stood longer in the defensive?"

Dennis held out his hands in mock humility and said: "I am ready for my chains. You shall see
with what fortitude I endure my captivity."

"It is well that you should show it somewhere, for you have not done so in your resistance.
But I parole you on your honor, to report at such times as I shall indicate and papa can spare
you;" and with a smile and a lingering look that seemed, as before, directed to his face rather
than himself, she passed out.

That peculiar look often puzzled him, and at times he would go to a glass and see if there
was anything wrong or unusual in his appearance. But now his hopes rose higher than ever. She
had been very gracious, certainly, and invited intimate companionship. Dennis felt that she
must have read his feelings in his face and manner, and, to his ingenuous nature, any encouragement
seemed to promise all he hoped.

For a week after this he scarcely saw her, for she was very busy making preliminary arrangements
for the occupation of her new home. But one afternoon she suddenly appeared, and said, with
affected severity, "Report to-mor-row at nine A.M."

Dennis bowed humbly. She gave him a pleasant smile over her shoulder, and passed away as quickly
as she had come. It seemed like a vision to him, and only a trace of her favorite perfume (which
indeed ever seemed more an atmosphere than a perfume) remained as evidence that she had been there.

At five minutes before the time on the following day he appeared at the new Ludolph mansion.
From an open window Christine beckoned him to enter, and welcomed him with characteristic words--"In
view of your foolish surrender to my power, remember that you have no rights that I am bound
to respect."

"I throw myself on your mercy."

"I have already told you that I do not possess that trait; so prepare for the worst."

She was dressed in some light summer fabric, and her rounded arms and neck were partially bare.
She looked so white and cool, so self-possessed, and, with all her smiles, so devoid of warm
human feeling, that Dennis felt a sudden chill at heart. The ancient fable of the sirens occurred
to him. Might she not be luring him on to his own destruction? At times he almost hoped that
she loved him; again, something in her manner caused him to doubt everything. But there were
not, as in the case of Ulysses and his crew, friendly hands to bind and restrain, or to put
wax in his ears, and soon the music of her voice, the strong enchantment of the love she had
inspired, banished all thought of prudence. His passion was now becoming a species of intoxication,
a continued and feverish excitement, and its influence was unhappy on mind and body. There
was no rest, peace, or assurance in it, and the uncertainty, the tantalizing inability to obtain
a definite satisfying word, and yet the apparent nearness of the prize, wore upon him. Sometimes,
when late at night he sat brooding over his last interview, weighing with the nice scale of
a lover's anxiety her every look and even accent, his own haggard face would startle him.

Then again her influence was not morally good, and his interest declined in everything save
what was connected with her.

Conscience at times told him that he was more bent on gaining her love for himself than in
winning it for God. He satisfied himself by trying to reason that when he had won her affection
his power for good would be greater, and thus, while he ever sought to look and suggest his
own love in nameless little ways, he made less and less effort to remind her of a better love
than even his. Moreover, she never encouraged any approach to sacred themes, sometimes repelling
it decidedly, and so, though he would scarcely acknowledge it, the traitorous fear sprung up,
that in speaking of God's love he might mar his chances of speaking of his own.

In the retirement of his own room, his reveries grew longer, and his prayers shorter and less
inspired by faith and earnestness. At the mission school, Susie Winthrop noticed with regret
that the lesson was often given in a listless, preoccupied manner; and even the little boys
themselves missed something in the teacher once so interesting and animated. From witnessing
his manner when with Christine, Miss Winthrop had more than suspected his secret for some time,
and she felt at first a genuine sympathy for him, believing his love to be hopeless. From the
first she had found Dennis very fascinating, but when she read his secret in his ardent glances
toward Christine, she became conscious that her interest was rather greater than passing acquaintance
warranted, and, like the good, sensible girl that she was, fought to the death the incipient
fancy. At first she felt that he ought to know that Christine was pledged to a future that
would render his love vain. But her own feelings made her so exceedingly sensitive that it
was impossible to attempt so difficult and delicate a task. Then, as Christine seemed to smile
upon him, she said to herself: "After all, what is their plan, but a plan, and to me a very
chimerical one? Perhaps Mr. Fleet can give Christine a far better chance of happiness than
her father's ambition. And, after all, these are matters in which no third person can interfere."
So, while remaining as cordial as ever, she prudently managed to see very little of Dennis.

As we have seen, under Christine's merry and half-bantering words (a style of conversation
often assumed with him), even the thought of caution vanished. She led him over the moderately
large and partially furnished house. There were women cleaning, and mechanics at work on some
of the rooms. As they passed along she explained the nature of the decorations she wished.
They consisted largely of rich carvings in wood, and unique frames.

"I wish you to help me design these, and see that they are properly put up, and to superintend
the fresco-painters and mechanics in general. Indeed, I think you are more truly my prime-minister
than my captive."

"Not less your captive," said Dennis, with a flush.

She gave him a bewildering smile, and then studied its effect upon him. He was in Elysium,
and his eyes glowed with delight at her presence and the prospect before him. At last she led
him into two large apartments on the second floor that opened into each other, and said, "These
are my rooms; that yonder is my studio," as was evident from the large easel with canvas prepared
upon it.

They at once had to Dennis all the sacredness of a shrine.

"I intend to make these rooms like two beautiful pictures," said Christine, "and here shall
be the chief display of your taste."

Dennis could scarcely believe his ears, or realize that the cold, beautiful girl who a few
short months ago did not notice him now voluntarily gave him such opportunities to urge his
suit. The success that a man most covets seemed assured, and his soul was intoxicated with
delight. He said, "You intimated that my tasks might be menial, but I feel as I imagine a Greek
artist must have done, when asked to decorate the temple of a goddess."

"I think I told you once before that your imagination overshadowed your other faculties."

Her words recalled the painted girl whom she by a strange coincidence so strongly resembled.
To his astonishment he saw the same striking likeness again. Christine was looking at him with
the laughing, scornful expression that the German lady bent upon the awkward lover who kneeled
at her feet. His face darkened in an instant.

"Have I offended you?" she asked, gently; "I remember now you did not admire that picture."

"I liked everything about it save the expression of the girl's face. I think you will also
remember that I said that such a face should be put to nobler uses."

Christine flushed slightly, and for a moment was positively afraid of him. She saw that she
must be more careful, for she was dealing with one of quick eye and mind. At the same time
her conscience reproached her again. The more she saw of him the more she realized how sincere
and earnest he was; how different from ordinary society-men, to whom an unsuccessful suit to
a fair lady is a mere annoyance. But she was not one to give up a purpose readily for the sake
of conscience or anything else, and certainly not now, when seemingly on the point of success.
So she said, with a slight laugh, "Do not compare me to any of those old pagan myths again;"
and having thus given a slight reason, or excuse, for her unfortunate expression, she proceeded
to beguile him more thoroughly than ever by the subtile witchery of smiles, glances, and words,
that might mean everything or nothing.

"You seem to have a study on your easel there," said Dennis, as they stood together in the
studio. "May I see it?"

"No," said she; "you are to see nothing till you see a triumph in the portrayal of feeling
and lifelike earnestness that even your critical eye cannot condemn."

She justly feared that, should he see her work, he might discover her plan; for, however she
might disguise it, something suggesting himself entered into all her studies.

"I hope you will succeed, but doubt it."

"Why?" she asked, quickly.

"Because we cannot portray what we cannot feel. The stream cannot rise higher than its fountain."
Then he added, with heightened color and some hesitation, "I fear--your heart is still sleeping";
and he watched with deep anxiety how she would take the questioning remark.

At first she flushed almost angrily; but, recovering self-possession in a moment, she threw
upon him an arch smile, suggesting all that a lover could wish, and said: "Be careful, Mr.
Fleet; you are seeking to penetrate mysteries that we most jealously guard. You know that in
the ancient temple there was an inner sanctuary which none might enter."

"Yes, one might," said Dennis, significantly.

With her long lashes she veiled the dark blue eyes that expressed anything but tender feeling,
and yet, so shaded, they appeared as a lover would wish, and in a low tone she answered, "Well,
he could not enter when he would, only when permitted."

She raised her eyes quickly to see the effect; and she did see an effect that she would have
given thousands to be able to transfer to canvas.

His face, above all she had ever seen, seemed designed to express feeling, passion; and his
wearing life had made it so thin, and his eyes were so large and lustrous, that the spiritual
greatly predominated, and she felt as if she could almost see the throbs of the strong, passionate
heart.

Apart from her artistic purposes, contact with such warm, intense life had for Christine a
growing fascination. She had not realized that in kindling and fanning this flame of honest
love to sevenfold power and heat, she might be kindled herself. When, therefore, she saw the
face of Dennis Fleet eloquent with the deepest, strongest feeling that human features can portray,
another chord than the artistic one was touched, and there was a low, faint thrill of that
music which often becomes the sweetest harmony of life.

"And at some time in the future may I hope to enter?" he asked, tremulously.

She threw him another smile over her shoulder as she turned to her easel--a smile that from
a true woman would mean, You may, but which from many would mean nothing, and said, vaguely,
"What is life without hope?" and then, as matters were going too fast and far, decisively changed
the subject.

Seated at her easel she painted eagerly and rapidly, while he measured the space over and around
the fireplace with a view to its ornamentation. She kept the conversation on the general subject
of art, and, though Dennis knew it not, every glance at his face was that of a portrait-painter.

CHAPTER XXXII

BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT

Dennis went back to the store in a maze of hopes and fears, but hope predominated. Christine
could not be indifferent and treat him as she did, if she had a particle of sincerity, and
with a lover's faith he would not believe her false, though he knew her to be so faulty.

"At any rate," he said to himself, "in this new arrangement I have all the opportunity a man
could ask, and if I cannot develop her plainly manifested interest into something more decisive
by such companionship, I may as well despair;" and he determined to avail himself of every
advantage within his reach in making the most of what he deemed a rare stroke of fortune. His
greatly increased salary enabled him to dress with that taste and even elegance so pleasing
to a lady's eye, and he had withal acquired that ease and grace of manner which familiarity
with the best society bestows.

It is also well to tell the reader that after some hesitation Dennis had confided his feelings
to his mother, and received from her the warmest sympathy. To Ethel Fleet's unworldly nature,
that he should fall in love with and marry his employer's daughter seemed eminently fitting,
with just a spice of beautiful romance. And it was her son's happiness and Christine's beauty
that she thought of, not Mr. Ludolph's money. In truth, such was her admiration for her son,
she felt that with all her wealth the young lady would receive a greater honor than she conferred.
Though Dennis wrote with the partiality of a lover, he could not so portray Christine's character
but that his mother felt the deepest anxiety, and often sighed in sad foreboding of serious
trouble in the future.

From Mrs. Fleet's knowledge of her son's passion, Christine, though she knew it not, received
another advantage of incalculable value. Dennis had painted an excellent little cabinet likeness
of her, and sent it to his mother. In the quiet of the night she would sit down before that
picture, and by her strong imagination summon her ideal of Christine, and then lead her directly
to Christ, as parents brought their children of old. Could such prayers and faith be in vain?
Faith is often sorely tried in this world, but never tried in vain.

Day after day Dennis went to Mr. Ludolph's new home during the morning hours, and Christine's
spell worked with bewildering and increasing power. While she tortured him with many doubts
and fears, his hope grew to be almost a certainty that he had at last made a place for himself
in her heart. Sometimes the whole story of his love trembled on his lips, but she never permitted
its utterance. That she determined should be reserved for the climax. He usually met her alone,
but noticed that in the presence of others she was cool and undemonstrative. Mr. Ludolph rarely
saw them together, and, when he did, there was nothing in his daughter's manner to awaken suspicion.
This perfectly acted indifference in the presence of others, and equally well acted regard
when alone, often puzzled Dennis sorely. But at last he concluded: "She is wiser than I. She
knows that I am in no condition now to make proposals for her hand; therefore it is better
that there should be no recognized understanding between us;" and he resolved to be as prudent
as she. Then again she would so awaken his jealousy and fears that he would feel that he must
know his fate--that anything was better than such torturing uncertainty.

As for Christine, two processes were going on in her mind--one that she recognized, and one
that she did not.

Her artistic aims were clear and definite. In the first place she meant perfectly to master
the human face as it expressed emotions, especially such as were of a tender nature; and in
the second place she intended to paint a picture that in itself would make her famous. She
chose a most difficult and delicate subject--of the character she had ever failed in--a declaration
of love.

When Dennis began to work again in her presence, the picture was well advanced.

In a grand old hall, whose sides were decorated with armor and weapons, a young man stood pleading
his cause with a lady whose hand he held. The young girl's face was so averted that only a
beautiful profile was visible, but her form and attitude were grace itself. The lovers stood
in an angle of the hall near an open window, through which was seen a fine landscape, a picture
within a picture. But Christine meant to concentrate all her power and skill on the young knight's
face. This should be eloquent with all the feeling and passion that the human face could express,
and she would insure its truthfulness to life by copying life itself--the reality. Dennis Fleet
was the human victim that she was offering on the altar of her ambition.

Much of the picture was merely in outline, but she finished the form and features of the suppliant
in all save the expression, and this she meant to paint from his face whenever she was in the
right mood and could bring matters to a crisis.

After he had been coming to the house two or three times a week for nearly a month she felt
that she was ready for the final scene, and yet she dreaded it, she had staked so much hope
upon it. It also provoked her to find that she was really afraid of him. His was such a strong,
sincere nature, that she felt increasingly the wrong of trifling with it. In vain she tried
to quiet herself by saying, "I do not care a straw for him, and he will soon get over his infatuation
on discovering the truth."

But she had a lesson to learn as well as he, for as we have intimated, unrecognized as yet,
there was a process going on in her mind that in time would make strange havoc in her cold
philosophy. Her heart's long winter was slowly breaking up; her girlish passion, intense as
it was foolish, proved that she had a heart. Everything had been against her. Everything in
her experience and education, and especially in her father's strong character and prejudices,
had combined to deaden and to chill her; and had these influences continued, she would undoubtedly
have become as cold and hard as some whom we find in advanced life with natures like the poles,
where the ice gathers year after year, but never melts.

But in Dennis Fleet she met a nature as positive as she was becoming negative. He was so warm
and earnest that when she commenced to fan his love into a stronger flame for purely artistic
purposes, as she vowed to herself, some sparks of the sacred fire fell on the cold altar of
her own heart and slowly began to kindle.

But this awakening would not now be that of a child, but of a woman. Therefore, Mr. Ludolph,
beware!

But she had yet much to learn in the hard, strange school of experience before she would truly
know herself or her own needs.

Success in art, however, was still her ruling passion. And though strange misgivings annoyed
and perplexed her, though her respect for Dennis daily increased, and at times a sudden pity
and softness made her little hands hesitate before giving an additional wrench to the rack
of uncertainty upon which she kept him; still, she would not for the world have abandoned her
purpose, and such compunctions were as yet but the little back eddies of the strong current.

One day, in the latter part of August, Christine felt herself in the mood to give the finishing
touch to the principal figure in her picture. The day was somewhat hazy, the light subdued
and favorable for artistic work. Though she had prolonged Dennis's labors, to his secret delight
and great encouragement, she could not keep him employed much longer. 

Accessory sense-apparatus.

Every sense except the "pain sense" has more or less of this. The hairs of the skin are accessory
to the sense of touch. A touch on a hair is so easily felt that we often think of the hairs
as sensitive; but really it is the skin that is sensitive, or, rather,
it is the sensory axon terminating around the root of the hair in
the skin.

The tongue can be thought of as accessory apparatus serving the sense of taste, and the breathing
apparatus as accessory to the sense of smell, "tasting" being largely
a tongue movement that brings the substance to the taste cells, and
"smelling" of anything being largely a series of little inspiratory
movements that carry the odor-laden air to the olfactory part of the
nasal cavity.

{193}

But it is in the eye and the ear that the highest development of accessory sense apparatus has
taken place. All of the eye except the retina, and all of the ear except the sense cells and
the sensory axons, are accessory.

The eye is an optical instrument, like the camera.

In fact, it is a camera, the sensitive plate being the retina, which differs indeed from the
ordinary photographic plate in recovering after an exposure so as to be ready for another.
Comparing the eye with the camera, we see that the eyeball corresponds to the box, the outer
tough coat {194} of the eyeball (the "sclerotic" coat) taking the place of the wood or metal of
which the box is built, and the deeply pigmented "choroid" coat, that lines the sclerotic,
corresponding to the coating of paint used to blacken the inside
of the camera box and prevent stray light from getting in and blurring
the picture.

At the front of the eye, where light is admitted, the sclerotic is transformed into the transparent "cornea",
and the choroid into the contractile "iris", with the hole in its
center that we call "the pupil of the eye".

The iris corresponds to the adjustable diaphragm of the camera.

"I have no right--do not think me prying," said he, flushing.

"I give the right. You know a lady can give many rights--if she chooses," she added, significantly.

He looked at her eagerly.

Her eyes fell consciously, and her cheeks glowed with excitement, for she felt that the critical
moment had come. But instantly her proud, resolute nature aroused as never before, and she
determined to make the most of the occasion, let the consequences be what they might. Therefore
she worked eagerly and watched him closely. Never had she been so conscious of power. She felt
inspired, capable of placing on the canvas anything she chose. If in this mood she could succeed
in bringing into his face just the expression she desired, she could catch it and fix it forever,
and with it make a laurel (not a hymeneal) wreath for her own brow. But what could Dennis know
of all this? To him the glowing cheek and eyes so lustrous told a different tale; and hope--sweet,
exquisite, almost assured--sprang up in his heart.

And he meant that it should be assured. He would speak that day if it were possible, and know
his happiness, instead of fondly believing and hoping that all was sure. Then he would be as
prudent and patient as she desired. Thus Christine was destined to have her wish fulfilled.

She continued: "The note is from a special friend of yours; indeed I think you form a little
mutual-admiration society, and you are spoken of, so I think you had better read it."

"I shall not read the note," said Dennis; "but you may tell me, if you choose, what you think
the writer will have no objection to my knowing."

"And do you mean to suggest that you do not know who wrote the note? I can inform you that
you are to be invited to a moonlight sail and musicale on the water. Is not that a chance for
romance?"

"And will you go?" asked Dennis, eagerly.

"Yes, if you will," she said, in a low tone, giving him a sidelong glance.

This was too much for Dennis, the manner more than the words, and taken together they would
have led any earnest man to committal. He was about to speak eagerly, but she was not quite ready.

"Moreover," she continued, quickly, while Dennis stood before her with cheeks alternately hot
and pale, "this special friend who invites you will be there. Now don't pretend ignorance of
her name."

"I suppose you mean Miss Winthrop," said Dennis, flushing.

"Ah, you blush, do you? Well, it is my turn to ask pardon for seeming curiosity."

He drew a few steps nearer to her, and the expression she had so longed to see came into his
face. She looked at him earnestly with her whole soul in her eyes. She would photograph him
on memory, if possible. For a moment or two he hesitated, embarrassed by her steady gaze, and
seemingly at a loss for words. Then, in a low, deep tone he said, "You, better than any one,
know that I have no cause to blush at the mention of Miss Winthrop's name."

She did not answer, but was painting rapidly. He thought this was due to natural excitement
expressing itself in nervous action. But she did not discourage him, and this he felt was everything.
With his heart in his eyes and tones, he said: "Oh, Christine, what is the use of wearing this
transparent mask any longer? Your quick woman's eye has seen for weeks the devoted love I cherish
for you. I have heard much of woman's intuitions. Perhaps you saw my love before I recognized
it myself, since your grace and beauty caused it to grow unconsciously while I was your humble
attendant. But, Christine, believe me, if you will but utter in words what I fondly believe
I have read in your kindly glances and manner, though so delicately veiled--if you will give
me the strength and rest which come of assured hope--I know that not far in the future I shall
be able to place at your feet more than mere wealth. I, too, hope to be an artist, and you
have been my chief inspiration. I could show you a picture now that would tell more of what
I mean than can my poor words. There is a richer and happier world than you have yet known,
and oh, how I have prayed that I might lead you into it!" and in words of burning eloquence
he proceeded to tell the story of his love.

She heard him as in a dream. She understood his words, remembered them afterward, but so intent
was she on her darling purpose that she heeded them not. His voice sounded far away, and every
power of mind and body was concentrated to transfer his expression to the canvas before her.
Even he, blinded as he was by his emotions, occupied by the long pent-up torrent of feeling
that he was pouring into her unheeding ear, wondered at her strange, dazzling beauty and peculiar
manner.

After speaking a moment or two, the blur over his eyes and the confusion of his mind began
to pass away, and he was perplexed beyond measure at the way she was receiving the open declaration
of his love. She was painting through it all, not with the nervous, random stroke of one who
sought to hide excitement and embarrassment in occupation. She was working earnestly, consciously,
with precision, and, what was strangest of all, she seemed so intent upon his face that his
words, which would have been such music to any woman that loved, were apparently unheard. He
stopped, but the break in his passionate flow of language was unnoted.

"Christine, listen to me!" he cried, in an agony of fear and perplexity. The tone of his appeal
might have stirred a marble bosom to pity, but she only raised her left hand deprecatingly
as if warding off an interruption, while she worked with intense eagerness with her right. 

Involuntarily you compared yourself with the swineherd that made Alfred
watch his cakes, or some bloated citizen who may have given his sons
and his condescension to the fallen Dionysius.

Nor were the disagreeables purely fanciful and metaphysical, for the sway that he exercised over
your feelings he extended to your garden, and, through the garden, to your diet. He would trim
a hedge, throw away a favourite plant, or fill the most favoured and fertile section of the
garden with a vegetable that none of us could eat, in supreme contempt for our opinion. If you
asked him to send you in one of your own artichokes, "THAT I WULL, MEM," he would say, "WITH PLEASURE,
FOR IT IS MAIR BLESSED TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE." Ay, and even when, by extra twisting of the
screw, we prevailed on him to prefer our commands to his own inclination,
and he went away, stately and sad, professing that "OUR WULL WAS HIS
PLEASURE," but yet reminding us that he would do it "WITH FEELIN'S,"
- even then, I say, the triumphant master felt humbled in his triumph,
felt that he ruled on sufferance only, that he was taking a mean advantage
of the other's low estate, and that the whole scene had been one of
those "slights that patient merit of the unworthy takes."

In flowers his taste was old-fashioned and catholic; affecting sunflowers and dahlias, wallflowers and
roses and holding in supreme aversion whatsoever was fantastic, new-fashioned or wild. There
was one exception to this sweeping ban.

Foxgloves, though undoubtedly guilty on the last count, he not only
spared, but loved; and when the shrubbery was being thinned, he stayed
his hand and dexterously manipulated his bill in order to save every
stately stem.

In boyhood, as he told me once, speaking in that tone that only actors and the old-fashioned
common folk can use nowadays, his heart grew "PROUD" within him when he came on a burn-course
among the braes of Manor that shone purple with their graceful trophies; and not all his apprenticeship
and practice for so many years of precise gardening had banished these boyish recollections
from his heart.

Indeed, he was a man keenly alive to the beauty of all that was bygone. He abounded in old stories
of his boyhood, and kept pious account of all his former pleasures; and when he went (on a
holiday) to visit one of the fabled great places of the earth where
he had served before, he came back full of little pre-Raphaelite reminiscences
that showed real passion for the past, such as might have shaken hands
with Hazlitt or Jean-Jacques.

But however his sympathy with his old feelings might affect his liking for the foxgloves, the
very truth was that he scorned all flowers together.

They were but garnishings, childish toys, trifling ornaments for ladies' chimney-shelves. It
was towards his cauliflowers and peas and cabbage that his heart
grew warm.

His preference for the more useful growths was such that cabbages were found invading the flower-pots,
and an outpost of savoys was once discovered in the centre of the
lawn.

He would prelect over some thriving plant with wonderful enthusiasm, piling reminiscence on reminiscence
of former and perhaps yet finer specimens.

Yet even then he did not let the credit leave himself. He had, indeed, raised "FINER O' THEM;" but
it seemed that no one else had been favoured with a like success.

All other gardeners, in fact, were mere foils to his own superior attainments; and he would
recount, with perfect soberness of voice and visage, how so and so had wondered, and such another
could scarcely give credit to his eyes. Nor was it with his rivals only that he parted praise
and blame. If you remarked how well a plant was looking, he would gravely touch his hat and
thank you with solemn unction; all credit in the matter falling to
him.

If, on the other hand, you called his attention to some back-going
vegetable, he would quote Scripture: "PAUL MAY PLANT AND APOLLOS MAY
WATER;" all blame being left to Providence, on the score of deficient
rain or untimely frosts.



"Yes, in a moment, and never again to enter it while Christine Ludolph is as false in character
as she is beautiful in person. But before I go, you, in your pride and luxury, shall hear the
truth for once. Not only have you been false, but you have been what no true woman ever can
be--cruel as death. Your pencil has been a stiletto with which you have slowly felt for my
heart. You have dipped your brush in human suffering as if it were common paint. Giotto stabbed
a man and mercifully took him off by a few quick pangs, that he might paint his dying look.
You, more cruel, accomplish your purpose by slow, remorseless torture. Merciful Heaven only
knows what I have suffered since you smiled and frowned on me by turns, but I felt that if
I could only win your love I would gladly endure all. You falsely made me believe that I had
won it, and yet all the while you were dissecting my heart, as a surgeon might a living subject.
And now what have you to offer to solace the bitterness of coming years? Do you not know that
such deeds make men bad, faithless, devilish? Never dream of success till you are changed utterly.
Only the noble in deed and in truth can reach high and noble art."

She sat before the disfigured picture with her face bowed in her hands.

She thought he was gone, but still remained motionless like one doomed. A few moments passed
and she was startled by hearing his voice again. It was no longer harsh and stern, but sad,
grave, and pitiful. "Miss Ludolph, may God forgive you."

She trembled. Pride and better feeling were contending for the mastery. After a few moments
she sprang up and reached out her hands; but he was gone now in very truth.

CHAPTER XXXIII

THE TWO PICTURES

When Christine saw that Dennis was not in the room, she rushed to a window only in time to
see his retreating form passing down the street. For a moment she felt like one left alone
to perish on a sinking wreck. His words, so assured in their tones, seemed like those of a
prophet. Conscience echoed them, and a chill of fear came over her heart. What if he were right?
What if she had let the one golden opportunity of her life pass? Even though she had stolen
her inspiration from him through guile and cruelty, had he not enabled her to accomplish more
than in all her life before? To what might he not have led her, if she had put her hand frankly
and truthfully in his? There are times when to those most bewildered in mazes of error light
breaks, clear and unmistakable, defining right and wrong with terrible distinctness. Such an
hour was this to Christine. The law of God written on her heart asserted itself, and she trembled
at the guilty thing she saw herself to be. But there seemed no remedy save in the one she had
driven away, never to return, as she believed. After a brief but painful revery she exclaimed:
"But what am I thinking of? What can he or any man of this land be to me?"

Then pride, her dominant trait, awoke as she recalled his words.

"He despises me, does he? I will teach him that I belong to a sphere he cannot touch--the poor
infatuated youth! And did he dream that I, Christine Ludolph, could give him my hand? He shall
learn some day that none in this land could receive that honor, and none save the proudest
in my own may hope for it. The idea of my giving up my ancient and honorable name for the sake
of this unknown Yankee youth."

Bold, proud words that her heart did not echo.

But pride and anger were now her controlling impulses, and with the strong grasp of her resolute
will she crushed back her gentler and better feelings, and became more icy and hard than ever.

By such choice and action, men and women commit moral suicide.

With a cold, white face, and a burnished gleam in her eyes, she went to the easel and commenced
painting out the ominous black stain.

"I'll prove him a false prophet also. I will be an artist without passing through all his sentimental
and superstitious phases that have so amused me during the past weeks. I have seen his lovelorn
face too often not to be able to reproduce it and its various expressions."

Her strokes were quick and almost fierce.

"Mrs. Dennis Fleet, ha! ha! ha!" and her laugh was as harsh and discordant as the feeling that
prompted it.

Again, a little later: "He despises me! Well, he is the first man that ever dared to say that;"
and her face was flushed and dark with anger.

Dennis at first walked rapidly from the scene of his bitter disappointment, but his steps soon
grew slow and feeble. The point of endurance was passed. Body and mind acting and reacting
on each other had been taxed beyond their powers, and both were giving way. He felt that they
were, and struggled to reach the store before the crisis should come. Weak and trembling, he
mounted the steps, but fell fainting across the threshold. One of the clerks saw him fall and
gave the alarm. Mr. Ludolph, Mr. Schwartz, and others hastened to the spot. Dennis was carried
to his room, and a messenger was despatched for Dr. Arten. Ernst, with flying feet, and wild,
frightened face, soon reached his home in De Koven Street, and startled his father and mother
with the tidings.

The child feared that Dennis was dead, his face was so thin and white. Leaving the children
in Ernst's care, both Mr. and Mrs. Bruder, prompted by their strong gratitude to Dennis, rushed
through the streets as if distracted. Their intense anxiety and warm German feeling caused
them to heed no more the curious glances cast after them than would a man swimming for life
note the ripple he made.

When Dennis regained consciousness, they, and Mr. Ludolph and Dr. Arten, were around him. At
first his mind was confused, and he could not understand it all.

"Where am I?" he asked, feebly, "and what has happened?"

"Do not be alarmed; you have only had a faint turn," said the doctor.

"Oh, Mr. Fleet, you vork too hart, you vork too hart; I knew dis vould come," sobbed Mrs. Bruder.

"Why, his duties in the store have not been so onerous of late," said Mr. Ludolph, in some
surprise.

"It is not der vork in der store, but he vork nearly all night too. Den he haf had trouble,
I know he haf. Do he say no vort about him?"

Dennis gave Mrs. Bruder a sudden warning look, and then, through the strong instinct to guard
his secret, roused himself.

"Is it anything serious, doctor?" he asked.

The physician looked grave, and said, "Your pulse and whole appearance indicate great exhaustion
and physical depression, and I also fear that fever may set in."

"I think you are right," said Dennis. "I feel as if I were going to be ill. My mind has a tendency
to wander. Mr. Ludolph, will you permit me to go home? If I am to be sick, I want to be with
my mother."

Mr. Ludolph looked inquiringly at the doctor, who said significantly, in a low tone, "I think
it would be as well."

"Certainly, Fleet," said his employer; "though I hope it is only a temporary indisposition,
and that you will be back in a few days. You must try and get a good night's rest, and so be
prepared for the journey in the morning."

"With your permission I will go at once. A train leaves now in an hour, and by morning I can
be at home."

"I scarcely think it prudent," began the doctor.

"Oh, certainly not to-night," said Mr. Ludolph, also.

"Pardon me, I must go at once," interrupted Dennis, briefly and so decidedly that the gentlemen
looked at each other and said no more.

"Mr. Bruder," he continued, "I must be indebted to you for a real proof of your friendship.
In that drawer you will find my money. The key is in my pocketbook. Will you get a carriage
and take me to the depot at once? and can you be so kind as to go on home with me? I cannot
trust myself alone. Mrs. Bruder, will you pack up what you think I need?" His faithful friends
hastened to do his bidding.

"Mr. Ludolph, you have been very kind to me. I am sorry this has occurred, but cannot help
it. I thank you gratefully, and will now trespass on your valuable time no longer."

Mr. Ludolph, feeling that he could be of no further use, said: "You will be back in a week,
Fleet. Courage. Good-by."

Dennis turned eagerly to the doctor and said: "Can you not give me something that will reduce
the fever and keep me sane a little longer? I know that I am going to be delirious, but would
reach the refuge of home first."

A prescription was given and immediately procured, and the doctor went away shaking his head.

"This is the way people commit suicide. They know no more about, or pay no more heed to, the
laws of health than the laws of China. Here is the result: This young fellow has worked in
a way that would break down a cast-iron machine, and now may never see Chicago again."

But Dennis might have worked even in his intense way for months and years without serious harm,
had not a fair white hand kept him on the rack of uncertainty and fear.

Not work, but worry, makes havoc of health.

In the gray dawn Ethel Fleet, summoned from her rest, received her son, weak, unconscious,
muttering in delirium, and not recognizing even her familiar face. He was indeed a sad, painful
contrast to the ruddy, buoyant youth who had left her a few short months before, abounding
in hope and life. But she comforted herself with the thought that neither sin nor shame had
brought him home.

We need not dwell on the weary weeks that followed. Dennis had every advantage that could result
from good medical skill and the most faithful nursing. But we believe that his life lay rather
in his mother's prayers of faith. In her strong realization of the spiritual world she would
go continually into the very presence of Jesus, and say, "Lord, he whom Thou lovest is sick";
or, like parents of old, she would seem by her importunity to bring the Divine Physician to
his very bedside.

Mr. Bruder, too, insisted on remaining, and watched with the unwearied faithfulness of one
who felt that he owed to Dennis far more than life. It was indeed touching to see this man,
once so desperate and depraved, now almost as patient and gentle as the mother herself, sitting
by his unconscious friend, often turning his eyes heavenward and muttering in deep guttural
German as sincere a prayer as ever passed human lips, that Dennis might be spared.

The hand of God seemed about to take him from them, but their strong, loving faith laid hold
of that hand, and put upon it the restraint that only reverent, believing prayer can. Dennis
lived. After many days delirium ceased, and the confused mind became clear. But during his
delirium Ethel and Mr. Bruder learned from the oft-repeated words, "Cruel, cruel Christine!"
the nature of the wound that had nearly destroyed his life.

Mr. Ludolph was late in reaching his home on the evening after Dennis was taken sick. Christine
sat in the dusk on the ivy-shaded piazza, awaiting him. He said, abruptly, "What have you been
doing to Fleet, over here?"

For a second her heart stood still, and she was glad the increasing gloom disguised her face.
By a great effort she replied, in a cool, matter-of-fact tone: "I do not understand your question.
Mr. Fleet was here this afternoon, and gave some finishing touches to my studio. I do not think
I shall need him any more."

Her quiet, indifferent voice would have disarmed suspicion itself.

"It is well you do not, for he seems to have received some 'finishing touches' himself. He
fell across the threshold of the store in a dead faint, and has gone home, threatened with
a serious illness."

Even her resolute will could not prevent a sharp, startled exclamation.

"What is the matter?" said her father, hastily; "you are not going to faint also, are you?"

"No," said Christine, quietly again; "but I am tired and nervous, and you told your news so
abruptly! Why, it seemed but a moment ago he was here at work, and now he is dangerously ill.
What an uncertain stumbling forward in the dark life is!"

This was a style of moralizing peculiarly distasteful to Mr. Ludolph--all the more repugnant
because it seemed true, and brought home in Dennis's experience. Anything that interfered with
his plans and interests, even though it might be God's providence, always angered him. And
now he was irritated at the loss of one of his best clerks, just as he was becoming of great
value; so he said, sharply: "I hope you are not leaning toward the silly cant of mysterious
providence. Life is uncertain stumbling only to fools who can't see the chances that fortune
throws in their way, or recognize the plain laws of health and success. This young Fleet has
been putting two days' work in one for the past four months, and now perhaps his work is done
forever, for the doctor looked very grave over him."

Again the shadow of night proved most friendly to Christine. Her face had a frightened, guilty
look that it was well her father did not see, or he would have wrung from her the whole story.
She felt the chill of a terrible dread at heart. If he should die, her conscience would give
a fearful verdict against her. She stood trembling, feeling almost powerless to move.

"Come," said her father, sharply, "I am hungry and tired."

"I will ring for lights and supper," said Christine hastily, and then fled to her own room.

When she appeared, her father was sitting at the table impatiently awaiting her. But her face
was so white, and there was such an expression in her eyes, that he started and said, "What
is the matter?"

His question irritated her, and she replied as sharply as he had spoken.

"I told you I was tired, and I don't feel well. I have been a month in constant effort to get
this house in order, and I am worn out, I suppose."

He looked at her keenly, but said more kindly, "Here, my dear, take this wine"; and he poured
out a glass of old port.

She drank it eagerly, for she felt she must have something that would give her life, warmth,
and courage. In a way she could not understand, her heart sank within her.

But she saw her father was watching her, and knew she must act skillfully to deceive him. Rallied
and strengthened by the generous wine, her resolute will was soon on its throne again, and
Mr. Ludolph with all his keen insight was no match for her. In a matter-of-fact tone she said:

"I do not see how we have worked Mr. Fleet to death. Does he charge anything of the kind?7'

"Oh, no! but he too seems possessed with the idea of becoming an artist. That drunken old Bruder,
whom he appears to have reformed, was giving him lessons, and after working all day he would
study much of the night and paint as soon as the light permitted in the morning. He might have
made something if he had had a judicious friend to guide him" ("And such you might have been,"
whispered her conscience), "but now he drops away like untimely fruit."

"It is a pity," said she, coolly, and changed the subject, as if she had dismissed it from
her mind.

Mr. Ludolph believed that Dennis was no more to his daughter than a useful clerk.

The next morning Christine rose pale and listless.

Her father said, "I will arrange my business so that we can go off on a trip in a few days."

When left alone she sat down at her easel and tried to restore the expression that had so delighted
her on the preceding day. But she could not. Indeed she was greatly vexed to find that her
tendency was to paint his stern and scornful look, which had made a deeper impression on her
mind than any she had even seen on his face, because so unexpected and novel. She became irritated
with herself, and cried, fiercely: "Shame on your weakness! You are unworthy of your blood
and ancestry. I will reproduce that face as it was before he so insolently destroyed it;" and
she bent over her easel with an expression not at all in harmony with her work. Unconsciously
she made a strange contrast, with her severe, hard face and compressed lips, to the look of
love and pleading she sought to paint. For several days she wrought with resolute purpose,
but found that her inspiration was gone.

At last she threw down her brush in despair, and cried: "I cannot catch it again. The wretch
either smiles or frowns upon me. I fear he was right: I have made my first and last success;"
and she leaned her head sullenly and despairingly on her hand. Again the whole scene passed
before her, and she dwelt upon every word, as she was beginning often to do now, in painful
revery. When she came to the words, "I too mean to be an artist. I could show you a picture
that would tell you far more of what I mean than can my poor words" she started up, and, hastily
arraying herself for the street, was soon on her way to the Art Building.

No one heeded her movements there, and she went directly upstairs to his room. Though simple
and plain, it had unmistakably been the abode of a gentleman and a person of taste. It was
partially dismantled, and in disorder from his hasty departure, and she found nothing which
satisfied her quest there. She hastened away, glad to escape from a place where everything
seemed full of mute reproach, and next bent her steps to the top floor of the building. In
a part half-filled with antiquated lumber, and seldom entered, she saw near a window facing
the east an easel with canvas upon it. She was startled at the throbbing of her heart.

"It is only climbing these long stairs," she said; but her words were belied by the hesitating
manner and eager face with which she approached and removed the covering from the canvas.

She gazed a moment and then put out her hand for something by which to steady herself. His
chair was near, and she sank into it, exclaiming: "He has indeed painted more than he--more
than any one--could put into words. He has the genius that I have not. All here is striking
and original;" and she sat with her eyes riveted to a painting that had revealed to her--herself.

Here was the secret of Dennis's toil and early work. Here were the results of his insatiable
demand for the incongruous elements of ice and sunlight.

Side by side were two emblematic pictures. In the first there opened before Christine a grotto
of ice. The light was thin and cold but very clear. Stalactites hung glittering from the vaulted
roof. Stalagmites in strange fantastic forms rose to meet them. Vivid brightness and beauty
were on every side, but of that kind that threw a chill on the beholder. All was of cold blue
ice, and so natural was it that the eye seemed to penetrate its clear crystal. To the right
was an opening in the grotto, through which was caught a glimpse of a summer landscape, a vivid
contrast to the icy cave.

But the main features of the picture were two figures. Sleeping on a couch of ice was the form
of a young girl. The flow of the drapery, the contour of the form, was grace itself, and yet
all was ice. But the face was the most wonderful achievement. Christine saw her own features,
as beautiful as in her vainest moments she had ever dared to hope. So perfect was the portrait
that the delicate blue veins branched across the temple in veiled distinctness. It was a face
that lacked but two things, life and love; and yet in spite of all its beauty the want of these
was painfully felt--all the more painfully, even as a lovely face in death awakens a deeper
sadness and regret.

One little icy hand grasped a laurel wreath, also of ice. The other hand hung listless, half
open, and from it had dropped a brush that formed a small stalagmite at her side.

Bending over her in most striking contrast was the figure of a young man, all instinct with
life, power, and feeling. Though the face was turned away, Dennis had suggested his own form
and manner. His left hand was extended toward the sleeping maiden, as if to awaken her, while
with the right he pointed toward the opening through which was seen the summer landscape, and
his whole attitude indicated an eager wish to rescue her. This was the first picture.

The second one was still more suggestive. At the entrance of the grotto, which looked more
cold than ever, in its partial shadow, Christine saw herself again, but how changed! She now
had a beauty which she could not believe in--could not understand.

The icy hue and rigidity were all gone. She stood in the warm sunlight, and seemed all warmth
and life. Her face glowed with feeling, yet was full of peace.

Instead of the barren ice, flowers were at her feet, and fruitful trees bent over her. Birds
were seen flitting through their branches. The bended boughs, her flowing costume, and the
tress of golden hair lifted from her temple, all showed that the summer wind was blowing.

Everything, in contrast with the frozen, death-like cave, indicated life, activity. Near her,
a plane-tree, which in nature's language is the emblem of genius, towered into the sky; around
its trunk twined the passion-flower, meaning, in Flora's tongue, "Holy love"; while just above
her head, sipping the nectar from an open blossom, was a bright-hued butterfly, the symbol
of immortality. By her side stood the same tall, manly form, with face still averted. He was
pointing, and her eyes, softened, and yet lustrous and happy, were following where a path wound
through a long vista, in alternate light and shadow, to a gate, that in the distance looked
like a pearl. Above and beyond it, in airy outline, rose the walls and towers of the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem.

For a long time she sat in rapt attention. Moment by moment the paintings in their meaning
grew upon her. At last her eyes filled with tears, her bosom rose and fell with an emotion
most unwonted, and in low tones she murmured: "Heavenly delusion! and taught with the logic
I most dearly love. Oh, that I could believe it! I would give ten thousand years of the life
I am leading to know that it is true. Is there, can there be a path that leads through light
or shade to a final and heavenly home? If this is true, in spite of all my father's keen and
seemingly convincing arguments, what a terrible mistake our life is!"

Then her thoughts reverted to the artist.

"What have I done in driving him away with contempt in his heart for me? I can no more affect
haughty superiority to the man who painted those pictures. Though he could not be my lover,
what a friend he might have been! I fear I shall never find his equal. Oh, this world of chaos
and confusion! What is right? What is best? What is truth? He might have taught me. But the
skilful hand that portrayed those wonderful scenes may soon turn to dust, and I shall go to
my grave burdened with the thought that I have quenched the brightest genius that will ever
shine upon me;" and she clasped her hands in an agony of regret.

Then came the thought of securing the pictures. Dropping a veil over her red eyes, she went
down and got some large sheets of paper, and by fastening them together made a secure covering.
Then she carried the light frame with the canvas to the second floor, and, summoning Ernst,
started homeward with her treasure. The boy obeyed with reluctance. Since the time she had
surprised him out of his secret in regard to the strawberries, he had never liked her, and
now he felt that in some way she was the cause of the sickness of his dearest friend. Christine
could not bear the reproach of his large, truthful eyes, and their walk was a silent one. At
parting she handed him a banknote, but he shook his head.

"Have you heard from Mr. Fleet?" she asked, with a flush.

The boy's lip quivered at the mention of that name, and he answered, hastily: "Fader wrote
moder Mr. Fleet was no better. I fear he die;" and in an agony of grief he turned and ran sobbing
away.

From under her veil Christine's tears were falling fast also, and she entered her elegant home
as if it had been a prison.

CHAPTER XXXIV

REGRET

The next day was the Sabbath, and a long, dreary one it was to Christine. But late in the afternoon
Susie Winthrop came with a pale, troubled face.

"Oh, Christine, have you heard the news?" she exclaimed.

Christine's heart stood still with fear, but by a great effort she said, composedly, "What news?"

"Mr. Fleet has gone home very ill; indeed, he is not expected to live."

For a moment she did not answer, and when she did it was with a voice unnaturally hard and
cold: "Have you heard what is the matter?"

Miss Winthrop wondered at her manner, but replied, "Brain fever, I am told."

"Is he delirious?" asked Christine, in a low tone.

"Yes, all the time. Ernst, the little office-boy, told me he did not know his own mother. It
seems that the boy's father is with Mrs. Fleet, helping take care of him."

Christine's face was averted and so colorless that it seemed like marble.

"Oh, Christine, don't you care?" said Susie, springing up and coming toward her.

"Why should I care?" was the quick answer.

Susie could not know that it was in reality but an incoherent cry of pain--the blind, desperate
effort of pride to shield itself. But the tone checked her steps and filled her face with reproach.

"Perhaps you have more reason to care than you choose to admit," she said, pointedly.

Christine flushed, but said, coldly: "Of course I feel an interest in the fate of Mr. Fleet,
as I do in that of every passing acquaintance. I feel very sorry for him and his friends";
but never was sympathy expressed in a voice more unnaturally frigid.

Susie looked at her keenly, and again saw the tell-tale flush rising to her cheek. She was
puzzled, but saw that her friend had no confidence to give, and she said, with a voice growing
somewhat cold also: "Well, really, Christine, I thought you capable of seeing as much as the
rest of us in such matters, but I must be mistaken, if you only recognized in Dennis Fleet
a passing acquaintance. Well, if he dies I doubt if either you or I look upon his equal again.
Under right influences he might have been one of the first and most useful men of his day.
But they need not tell me it was overwork that killed him. I know it was trouble of some kind."

Christine was very pale, but said nothing; and Susie, pained and mystified that the confidence
of other days was refused, bade her friend a rather cold and abrupt adieu.

Left alone, Christine bowed her white face in her hands and sat so still that it seemed as
if life had deserted her. In her morbid state she began to fancy herself the victim of some
terrible fatality. Her heart had bounded when Susie Winthrop was announced, believing that
from her she would gain sympathy; but in strange perversity she had hidden her trouble from
her friend, and permitted her to go away in coldness. Christine could see as quickly and as
far as any, and from the first had noted that Dennis was very interesting to her friend. Until
of late she had not cared, but now for some reason the fact was not pleasing, and she felt
a sudden reluctance to speak to Susie of him.

Now that she was alone a deeper sense of isolation came over her than she had ever felt before.
Her one confidential friend had departed, chilled and hurt. She made friends but slowly, and,
having once become estranged, from her very nature she found it almost impossible to make the
first advances toward reconciliation.

Soon she heard her father's steps, and fled to her room to nerve herself for the part she must
act before him. But she was far from successful; her pale face and abstracted manner awakened
his attention and his surmises as to the cause. Having an engagement out, he soon left her
to welcome solitude; for when she was in trouble he was no source of help or comfort.

Monday dragged wearily to a close. She tried to work, but could not. She took up the most exciting
book she could find, only to throw it down in despair. Forever before the canvas or the page
would rise a pale thin face, at times stern and scornful, again full of reproach, and then
of pleading.

Even at night her rest was disturbed, and in dreams she heard the mutterings of his delirium,
in which he continually charged her with his death. At times she would take his picture from
its place of concealment, and look at it with such feelings as would be awakened by a promise
of some priceless thing now beyond reach forever. Then she would become irritated with herself,
and say, angrily: "What is this man to me? Why am I worrying about one who never could be much
more to me living than dead? I will forget the whole miserable affair."

But she could not forget. Tuesday morning came, but no relief. "Whether he lives or dies he
will follow me to my grave!" she cried. "From the time I first spoke to him there has seemed
no escape, and in strange, unexpected ways he constantly crosses my path!"

She felt that she must have some relief from the oppression on her spirit. Suddenly she thought
of Ernst, and at once went to the store and asked if he had heard anything later. He had not,
but thought that his mother would receive a letter that day.

"I want to see your father's picture, and will go home that way, if you will give me the number."

The boy hesitated, but at last complied with her wish.

A little later Christine knocked at Mr. Bruder's door. There was no response, though she heard
a stifled sound within. After a little she knocked more loudly. Then the door slowly opened,
and Mrs. Bruder stood before her. Her eyes were very red, and she held in her hand an open
letter. Christine expected to find more of a lady than was apparent at first glance in the
hard-working woman before her, so she said, "My good woman, will you tell Mrs. Bruder I would
like to see her?"

"Dis is Mrs. Bruder," was the answer.

Then Christine noticed the letter, and the half-effaced traces of emotion, and her heart misgave
her; but she nerved herself to say, "I came to see your husband's picture."

"It is dere," was the brief reply.

Christine began to expatiate on its beauty, though perhaps for the first time she looked at
a fine picture without really seeing it. She was at a loss how to introduce the object of her
visit, but at last said, "Your husband is away?"

"Yes."

"He is taking care of one of my father's--of Mr. Fleet, I am told. Have you heard from him
as to Mr. Fleet's health?"

"Dis is Miss Ludolph?"

"Yes."

"You can no read Sherman?"

"Oh, yes, I can. German is my native tongue."

"Strange dot him should be so."

"Why?"

"Der Shermans haf hearts."

Christine flushed deeply, but Mrs. Bruder without a word put her husband's letter into her
hand, and Christine read eagerly what, translated, is as follows:

"MY DEAR WIFE--Perhaps before this reaches you our best friend, our human savior, will be in
heaven. There is a heaven, I believe as I never did before; and when Mrs. Fleet prays the gate
seems to open, and the glory to stream right down upon us. But I fear now that not even her
prayers can keep him. Only once he knew her; then he smiled and said, 'Mother, it is all right,'
and dropped asleep. Soon fever came on again, and he is sinking fast. The doctor shakes his
head and gives no hope. My heart is breaking. Marguerite, Mr. Fleet is not dying a natural
death; he has been slain. I understand all his manner now, all his desperate hard work. He
loved one above him in wealth--none could be above him in other respects--and that one was
Miss Ludolph. I suspected it, though till delirious, he scarcely ever mentioned her name. But
now I believe she played with his heart--the noblest that ever beat--and then threw it away,
as if it were a toy instead of the richest offering ever made to a woman. Proud fool that she
was; she has done more mischief than a thousand such frivolous lives as hers can atone for.
I can write no more; my heart is breaking with grief and indignation."

As Christine read she suffered her veil to drop over her face. When she looked up she saw that
Mrs. Bruder's gaze was fixed upon her as upon the murderer of her best friend. She drew her
veil closer about her face, laid the letter down, and left the room without a word. She felt
so guilty and miserable on her way home that it would scarcely have surprised her had a policeman
arrested her for the crime with which her own conscience, as well as Mr. Bruder's letter, charged
her; and yet her pride revolted at it all.

"Why should this affair take so miserable a form with me?" she said. "To most it ends with
a few sentimental sighs on one side, and as a good joke on the other. All seems to go wrong
of late, and I am destined to have everything save happiness and the success upon which I set
my heart. There is no more cruel mockery than to give one all save the very thing one wants;
and, in seeking to grasp that, I have brought down upon myself this wretched, blighting experience.
On this chaotic world! The idea of there being a God! Why, I could make a better world myself!"
and she reached her home in such a morbid, unhappy state, that none in the great city need
have envied the rich and flattered girl. Mechanically she dressed and came down to dinner.

During the afternoon Ernst, while out on an errand, had slipped home and heard the sad news.
He returned to Mr. Ludolph's office crying. To the question, "What is the matter?" he had answered,
"Oh, Mr. Fleet is dying; he is dead by dis time!"

Mr. Ludolph was sadly shocked and pained, for as far as he could like anybody besides himself
and daughter, he had been prepossessed in favor of his useful and intelligent clerk, and he
was greatly annoyed at the thought of losing him. He returned full of the subject, and the
first words with which he greeted Christine were, "Well, Fleet will hang no more pictures for
you, and sing no more songs."

She staggered into a chair and sat before him pale and panting, for she thought he meant that
death had taken place.

"Why, what is the matter?" cried he.

She stared at him gaspingly, but said nothing.

"Here, drink this," he said, hastily pouring out a glass of wine.

She took it eagerly. After a moment he said: "Christine, I do not understand all this. I was
merely saying that my clerk, Mr. Fleet, was not expected--"

The point of endurance and guarded self-control was past, and she cried, half-hysterically:
"Am I never to escape that man? Must every one I meet speak to me as if I had murdered him?"

Then she added, almost fiercely: "Living or dead, never speak to me of him again! I am no longer
a child, but a woman, and as such I insist that his name be dropped between us forever!"

Her father gave a low exclamation of surprise, and said, "What! was he one of the victims?"
(this being his term for Christine's rejected suitors).

"No," said she; "I am the victim. He will soon be at rest, while I shall be tormented to the
grave by--" She hardly knew what to say, so mingled and chaotic were her feelings. Her hands
clenched, and with a stamp of her foot she hastily left the room.

Mr. Ludolph could hardly believe his eyes. Could this passionate, thoroughly aroused woman
be his cold, self-contained daughter? He could not understand, as so many cannot, that such
natures when aroused are tenfold more intense than those whom little things excite. A long
and peculiar train of circumstances, a morbid and overwrought physical condition, led to this
outburst from Christine, which was as much a cause of surprise to herself afterward as to her
father. He judged correctly that a great deal had occurred between Dennis and herself of which
he had no knowledge, and again his confidence in her was thoroughly shaken.

At first he determined to question her and extort the truth. But when, an hour later, she quietly
entered the parlor, he saw at a glance that the cold, proud, self-possessed woman before him
would not submit to the treatment accepted by the little Christine of former days. The wily
man read from her manner and the expression of her eye that he might with her consent lead,
but could not command without awakening a nature as imperious as his own.

He was angry, but he had time to think. Prudence had given a decided voice in favor of caution.

He saw what she did not recognize herself, that her heart had been greatly touched, and in
his secret soul he was not sorry now to believe that Dennis was dying.

"Father," said Christine, abruptly, "how soon can we start on our eastern trip?"

"Well, if you particularly wish it," he replied, "I can leave by the evening train to-morrow."

"I do wish it very much," said Christine, earnestly, "and will be ready."

After an evening of silence and constraint they separated for the night.

Mr. Ludolph sat for a long time sipping his wine after she had gone.

"After all it will turn out for the best," he said. "Fleet will probably die, and then will
be out of the way. Or, if he lives, I can easily guard against him, and it will go no further.
If she had been bewitched by a man like Mr. Mellen, the matter would have been more difficult.

"In truth," he continued, after a little, "now that her weak woman's heart is occupied by an
impossible lover, there is no danger from possible ones;" and the man of the world went complacently
to his rest, believing that what he regarded as the game of life was entirely in his own hands.

The next evening the night express bore Christine from the scene of the events she sought to
escape; but she was to learn, in common with the great host of the sinning and suffering, how
little change of place has to do with change of feeling. We take memory and character with
us from land to land, from youth to age, from this world to the other, from time through eternity.
Sad, then, is the lot of those who ever carry the elements of their own torture with them.

It was Christine's purpose, and she had her father's consent, to make a long visit in New York,
and, in the gayety and excitement of the metropolis, to forget her late wretched experience.

As it was still early in September, they resolved to stop at West Point and participate in
the gayest season of that fashionable watering-place. At this time the hotels are thronged
with summer tourists returning homeward from the more northern resorts. Though the broad piazzas
of Cozzens's great hotel were crowded by the elite of the city, there was a hum of admiration
as Christine first made her round on her father's arm; and in the evening, when the spacious
parlor was cleared for dancing, officers from the post and civilians alike eagerly sought her
hand, and hundreds of admiring eyes followed as she swept through the mazes of the dance, the
embodiment of grace and beauty. She was very gay, and her repartee was often brilliant, but
a close observer would have seen something forced and unnatural in all. Such an observer was
her father. He saw that the sparkle of her eyes had no more heart and happiness in it than
that of the diamonds on her bosom, and that with the whole strength of her resolute nature
she was laboring to repel thought and memory. But, as he witnessed the admiration she excited
on every side, he became more determined than ever that his fair daughter should shine a star
of the first magnitude in the salons of Europe. At a late hour, and wearied past the power
of thought, she gladly sought refuge in the blank of sleep.

The next morning they drove out early, before the sun was high and warm. It was a glorious
autumn day. Recent rains had purified the atmosphere, so that the unrivalled scenery of the
Hudson stood out in clear and grand outline.

As Christine looked about her she felt a thrill of almost delight--the first sensation of the
kind since that moment of exultation which Dennis had inspired, but which he had also turned
to the bitterness of disaster and humiliation. She was keenly alive to beauty, and she saw
it on every side. The Ludolph family had ever lived among the mountains on the Rhine, and the
heart of this latest child of the race yearned over the rugged scenery before her with hereditary
affection, which had grown stronger with each successive generation.

The dew, like innumerable pearls, gemmed the grass in the park-like lawn of the hotel, and
the slanting rays of the sun flecked the luxuriant foliage. Never before had this passion for
the beautiful in nature been so gratified, and all the artist feeling within her awoke.

On reaching the street the carriage turned southward, and, after passing the village of Highland
Falls, entered on one of the most beautiful drives in America. At times the road led under
overarching forest-trees, shaded and dim with that delicious twilight which only myriads of
fluttering leaves can make. Again it would wind around some bold headland, and the broad expanse
of the Hudson would shine out dotted with white sails. Then through a vista its waters would
sparkle, suggesting an exquisite cabinet picture. On the right the thickly-wooded mountains
rose like emerald walls, with here and there along their base a quiet farmhouse. With kindling
eye and glowing cheeks she drank in view after view, and at last exclaimed, "If there were
only a few old castles scattered among these Highlands, this would be the very perfection of
scenery."

Her father watched her closely, and with much satisfaction.

"After all, her wound is slight," he thought, "and new scenes and circumstances will soon cause
her to forget."

Furtively, but continually, he bent his eyes upon her, as if to read her very soul. A dreamy,
happy expression rested on her face, as if a scene were present to her fancy even more to her
taste than the one her eyes dwelt upon. In fact she was living over that evening at Miss Winthrop's,
when Dennis had told her that she could reach truest and highest art--that she could feel--could
copy anything she saw; and exhilarated by the fresh morning air, inspired by the scenery, she
felt for the moment, as never before, that it might all be true.

Was he who gave those blissful assurances also exerting a subtile, unrecognized power over
her? Certainly within the last few weeks she had been subject to strange moods and reveries.
But the first dawning of a woman's love is like the aurora, with its strange, fitful flashes.
The phenomena have never been satisfactorily explained.

But, as Mr. Ludolph watched complacently and admiringly, her expression suddenly changed, and
a frightened, guilty look came into her face. The glow upon her cheeks gave place to extreme
pallor, and she glanced nervously around as if fearing something, then caught her father's
eye, and was conscious of his scrutiny. She at once became cold and self-possessed, and sat
at his side pale and quiet till the ride ended. But he saw from the troubled gleam of her eyes
that beneath that calm exterior were tumult and suffering. Few in this life are so guilty and
wretched as not to have moments of forgetfulness, when the happier past comes back and they
are oblivious of the painful present. Such a brief respite Christine enjoyed during part of
her morning ride. The grand and swiftly varying scenery crowded her mind with pleasant images,
which had been followed by a delicious revery. She felt herself to be a true priestess of Nature,
capable of understanding and interpreting her voices and hidden meanings--of catching her evanescent
beauty and fixing it on the glowing canvas. The strong consciousness of such power was indeed
sweet and intoxicating. Her mind naturally reverted to him who had most clearly asserted her
possession of it.

"He, too, would have equal appreciation of this scenery," she said to herself.

Then came the sudden remembrance, shrivelling her pretty dreams as the lightning scorches and
withers.

"He--he is dead!--he must be by this time!"

And dread and guilt and something else which she did not define, but which seemed more like
a sense of great loss, lay heavy at her heart. No wonder her father was perplexed and provoked
by the sad change in her face. At first he was inclined to remonstrate and put spurs to her
pride. But there was a dignity about the lady at his side, even though she was his daughter,
that embarrassed and restrained him. Moreover, though he understood much and suspected far
more--more indeed than the truth--there was nothing acknowledged or tangible that he could
lay hold of, and she meant that it should be so. For reasons she did not understand she felt
a disinclination to tell her troubles to Susie Winthrop, and she was most resolute in her purpose
never to permit her father to speak on the subject.

If Mr. Ludolph had been as coarse and ignorant as he was hard and selfish, he would have gone
to work at the case with sledge-hammer dexterity, as many parents have done, making sad, brutal
havoc in delicate womanly natures with which they were no more fit to deal than a blacksmith
with hair-springs. But though he longed to speak, and bring his remorseless logic to bear,
Christine's manner raised a barrier which a man of his fine culture could not readily pass.

She joined her father at a late breakfast, smiling and brilliant, but her gayety was clearly
forced. The morning was spent in sketching, she seeming to crave constant occupation or excitement.

In the afternoon father and daughter drove up the river to the military grounds to witness
a drill. Mr. Ludolph did his best to rally Christine, pointing out everything of interest.
First, the grand old ruin of Fort Putnam frowned down upon them. This had been the one feature
wanting, and Christine felt that she could ask nothing more. Her wonder and admiration grew
as the road wound along the immediate bluff and around the plain by the river fortifications.
But when she stood on the piazza of the West Point Hotel, and looked up through the Highlands
toward Newburgh, tears came to her eyes, and she trembled with excitement. From her recent
experiences her nerves were morbidly sensitive. But her father could only look and wonder,
she seemed so changed to him.

"And is the Rhine like this?" she asked.

"Well, the best I can say is, that to a German and a Ludolph it seems just as beautiful," he
replied.

"Surely," said she, slowly and in half-soliloquy, "if one could live always amid such scenes
as these, the Elysium of the gods or the heaven of the Christians would offer few temptations."

"And among just such scenes you shall live after a short year passes," he answered, warmly
and confidently. But with anger he missed the wonted sparkle of her eyes when these cherished
plans were broached.

In bitterness Christine said to herself: "A few weeks since this thought would have filled
me with delight. Why does it not now?"

Silently they drove to the parade-ground. At the sally-port of the distant barracks bayonets
were gleaming. There was a burst of martial music, then each class at the Academy--four companies--came
out upon the grassy plain upon the double-quick. Their motions were light and swift, and yet
so accurately timed that each company seemed one perfect piece of mechanism. A cadet stood
at a certain point with a small color flying. Abreast of this their advance was checked as
suddenly as if they had been turned to stone, and the entire corps was in line. Then followed
a series of skilful manoeuvres, in which Christine was much interested, and her old eager manner
returned.

"I like the army," she exclaimed; "the precision and inflexible routine would just suit me.
I wish there was war, and I a man, that I might enter into the glorious excitements."

Luxurious Mr. Ludolph had no tastes in that direction, and, shrugging his shoulders, said:
"How about the hardships, wounds, and chances of an obscure death? These are the rule in a
campaign; the glorious excitements the exceptions."

"I did not think of those," she said, shrinking against the cushions. "Everything seems to
have so many miserable drawbacks!"

The pageantry over, the driver turned and drove northward through the most superb scenery.

"Where are we going?" asked Christine.

"To the cemetery," was the reply.

"No, no! not there!" she exclaimed, nervously.

"Nonsense! Why not?" remonstrated her father.

"I don't wish to go there!" she cried, excitedly. "Please turn around."

Her father reluctantly gave the order, but added, "Christine, you certainly indulge in strange
moods and whims of late."

She was silent a moment, and then she began a running fire of questions about the Academy,
that left no space for explanations.

That evening she danced as resolutely as ever, and by her beauty and brilliant repartee threw
around her many bewildering spells that even the veterans of the Point could scarcely resist.

But when alone in her own room she looked at her white face in the mirror, and murmured in
tones full of unutterable dread and remorse, "He is dead--he must be dead by this time!"

CHAPTER XXXV

REMORSE

Christine had a peculiar experience while at West Point. She saw on every side what would have
brought her the choicest enjoyment, had her mind been at rest. To her artist nature, and with
her passion and power for sketching, the Highlands on the Hudson were paradise. But though
she saw in profusion what once would have delighted her, and what she now felt ought to be
the source of almost unmingled happiness, she was still thoroughly wretched. It was the old
fable of Tantalus repeating itself. Her sin and its results had destroyed her receptive power.
The world offered her pleasures on every side; she longed to enjoy them, but could not, for
her heart was preoccupied--filled and overflowing with fear, remorse, and a sorrow she could
not define.

A vain, shallow girl might soon have forgotten such an experience as Christine had passed through.
Such a creature would have been sentimental or hysterical for a little time, according to temperament,
and then with the old zest have gone to flirting with some new victim. There are belles so
weak and wicked that they would rather plume themselves on the fact that one had died from
love of them. But in justice to all such it should be said that they rarely have mind enough
to realize the evil they do. Their vanity overshadows every other faculty, and almost destroys
those sweet, pitiful, unselfish qualities which make a true woman what a true man most reverences
next to God.

Christine was proud and ambitious to the last degree, but she had not this small vanity. She
did not appreciate the situation fully, but she was unsparing in her self-condemnation.

If Dennis had been an ordinary man, and interested her no more than had other admirers, and
had she given him no more encouragement, she would have shrugged her shoulders over the result
and said she was very sorry he had made such a fool of himself.

But as she went over the past (and this now she often did), she saw that he was unusually gifted;
nay, more, the picture she discovered in the loft of the store proved him possessed of genius
of a high order. And such a man she had deceived, tortured, and even killed! This was the verdict
of her own conscience, the assertion of his own lips. She remembered the wearing life of alternate
hope and fear she had caused him. She remembered how eagerly he hung on her smiles and sugared
nothings, and how her equally causeless frowns would darken all the world to him. She saw day
after day how she had developed in a strong, true heart, with its native power to love unimpaired,
the most intense passion, and all that her own lesser light might burn a little more brightly.
Then, with her burning face buried in her hands, she would recall the bitter, shameful consummation.
Worse than all, waking or sleeping, she continually saw a pale, thin face, that even in death
looked upon her with unutterable reproach. In addition to the misery caused by her remorse,
there was a deeper bitterness still. Within the depths of her soul a voice told her that the
picture was true; that he might have awakened her, and led her out into the warmth and light
of a happy life--a life which she felt ought to be possible, but which as yet had been but
a vague and tantalizing dream. Now the world seemed to her utter chaos--a place of innumerable
paths leading nowhere; and her own hands had broken the clew that might have brought her to
something assured and satisfactory. She was very wretched, for her life seemed but a little
point between disappointment on one side and the blackness of death and nothingness on the
other. The very beauty of the landscapes about her often increased her pain. She felt that
a few weeks ago she would have enjoyed them keenly, and found in their transference to canvas
a source of unfailing pleasure. With a conscious blush she thought that if he were present
to encourage, to stimulate her, by the very vitality of his earnest, loving nature, she would
be in the enjoyment of paradise itself. In a word, she saw the heaven she could not enter.

To the degree that she had mind, heart, conscience, and an intense desire for true happiness,
she was unhappy. Dress, dancing, the passing admiration of society, the pleasures of a merely
fashionable life, seemed less and less satisfactory. She was beyond them, as children outgrow
their toys, because she had a native superiority to them, and yet they seemed her best resource.
She had all her old longing to pursue her art studies, and everything about her stimulated
her to this, but her heart and hand appeared paralyzed. She was in just that condition, mental
and moral, in which she could do nothing well.

And so the days passed in futile efforts to forget--to drown in almost reckless gayety--the
voices of conscience and memory. But she only remembered all the more vividly; she only saw
the miserable truth all the more clearly. She suffered more in her torturing consciousness
than Dennis in his wild delirium.

After they had been at the hotel about a week, Mr. Ludolph received letters that made his speedy
return necessary. On the same day the family of his old New York partner arrived at the house
on their return from the Catskills. Mrs. Von Brakhiem gladly received Christine under her care,
feeling that the addition of such a bright star would make her little constellation one of
the most brilliant in the fashionable world.

The ladies of the house were now immersed in the excitement of an amateur concert. Mrs. Von
Brakhiem, bent upon shining among the foremost, though with a borrowed lustre, assigned Christine
a most prominent part. She half shrank from it, for it recalled unpleasant memories; but she
could not decline without explanations, and so entered into the affair with a sort of recklessness.

The large parlors were filled with chairs, which were soon occupied, and it was evident that
in point of attraction elegant toilets would vie with the music. Christine came down on her
father's arm, dressed like a princess, and, though her diamonds were few, such were their size
and brilliancy that they seemed on fire. Every eye followed Mrs. Von Brakhiem's party, and
that good lady took half the admiration to herself.

A superior tenor, with an unpronounceable foreign name, had come up from New York to grace
the occasion. But personally he lacked every grace himself, his fine voice being the one thing
that redeemed him from utter insignificance in mind and appearance. Nevertheless he was vain
beyond measure, and made the most of himself on all occasions.

The music was fine, for the amateurs, feeling that they had a critical audience, did their
best. Christine chose three brilliant, difficult, but heartless pieces as her contribution
to the entertainment (she would not trust herself with anything else); and with something approaching
reckless gayety she sought to hide the bitterness at her heart. Her splendid voice and exquisite
touch doubled the admiration her beauty and diamonds had excited, and Mrs. Von Brakhiem basked
in still stronger reflected light. She took every opportunity to make it known that she was
Miss Ludolph's chaperon.

After her first effort, the "distinguished" tenor from New York opened his eyes widely at her;
at her second, he put up his eyeglass in something like astonishment; and the close of her
last song found him nervously rummaging a music portfolio in the corner.

But for Christine the law of association had become too strong, and the prolonged applause
recalled the evening at Miss Brown's when the same sounds had deafened her, but when turning
from it all she had seen Dennis Fleet standing in rapt attention, his lips parted, his eyes
glowing with such an honest admiration that even then it was worth more to her than all the
clamor. Then, by the same law of association, she again saw that eager, earnest face, changed
pale, dead--dead!--and she the cause. Regardless of the compliments lavished upon her, she
buried her face in her hands and trembled from head to foot.

But the irrepressible tenor had found what he wanted, and now came forward asking that Miss
Ludolph would sing a duet with him.

She lifted a wan and startled face. Must the torturing similarity and still more torturing
contrast of the two occasions be continued? But she saw her father regarding her sternly--saw
that she was becoming the subject of curious glances and whispered surmises. Her pride was
aroused at once, and, goaded on by it, she said, "Oh, certainly; I am not feeling well, but
it does not signify."

"And den," put in the tenor, "dis is von grand occazeon to you, for it is so unfrequent dat
I find any von vorthy to sing dis style of music vith me."

"What is the music?" asked Christine, coldly.

To her horror she found it the same selection from Mendelssohn that she had sung with Dennis.

"No," she said, sharply, "I cannot sing that."

"Pardon me, my daughter, you can sing it admirably if you choose," interposed her father.

She turned to him imploringly, but his face was inflexible, and his eyes had an incensed look.
For a moment she, too, was angry. Had he no mercy? She was about to decline coldly, but her
friends were very urgent and clamorous--"Please do," "Don't disappoint us," echoing on every
side. The tenor was so surprised and puzzled at her insensibility to the honor he had conferred,
that, to prevent a scene she could not explain, she went to the piano as if led to the stake.

But the strain was too great upon her in her suffering state. The familiar notes recalled so
vividly the one who once before had sung them at her side that she turned almost expecting
to see him--but saw only the vain little animated music-machine, who with many contortions
was producing the harmony. "Just this mockery my life will ever be," she thought; "all that
I am, the best I can do, will always be connected with something insignificant and commonplace.
The rich, impassioned voice of the man who sang these words, and who might have taught me to
sing the song of a new and happier life, I have silenced forever."

The thought overpowered her. Just then her part recurred, but her voice died away in a miserable
quaver, and again she buried her face in her hands. Suddenly she sprang from the piano, darted
through the low-cut open window near, and a moment later ordered her startled maid from the
room, turned the key, and was alone.

Her father explained coldly to the astonished audience and the half-paralyzed tenor (who still
stood with his mouth open) that his daughter was not at all well that evening, and ought not
to have appeared at all. This Mrs. Von Brakhiem took up and repeated with endless variations.
But the evidences of sheer mental distress on the part of Christine had been too clear, and
countless were the whispered surmises of the fashionable gossips in explanation.

Mrs. Von Brakhiem herself, burning with curiosity, soon retired, that she might receive from
her lovely charge some gushing confidences, which she expected, as a matter of course, would
be poured into what she chose to regard as her sympathizing ear. But she knocked in vain at
Christine's door.

Later Mr. Ludolph knocked. There was no answer.

"Christine!" he called.

After some delay a broken voice answered, "You cannot enter--I am not well--I have retired."

He turned on his heel and strode away, and that night drank more brandy and water than was
good for him.

As for Christine, warped and chilled though her nature had been, she was still a woman, she
was still young, and, though she knew it not, she had heard the voice which had spoken her
heart into life. Through a chain of circumstances for which she was partly to blame, she had
been made to suffer as she had not believed was possible. The terrible words of Mr. Bruder's
letter rang continually in her ears--"Mrs. Fleet is not dying a natural death; he has been, slain."

For many long, weary days the conviction had been growing upon her that she had indeed slain
him and mortally wounded herself. Until to-night she had kept herself outwardly under restraint,
but now the long pent-up feeling gave way, and she sobbed as if her heart would break--sobbed
till the power to weep was gone. If now some kind, judicious friend had shown her that she
was not so guilty as she deemed herself; that, however, frightful the consequences of such
acts, she was really not to blame for what she did not intend and could not foresee; more than
all, if she could only have known that her worst fears about Dennis were not to be realized,
and that he was now recovering, she might at once have entered on a new and happier life. But
there was no such friend, no such knowledge, and her wounded spirit was thrown back upon itself.

At last, robed as she had been for the evening, she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion and grief--for
grief induces sleep.

The gems that shone in her dishevelled hair; that rose and fell as at long intervals her bosom
heaved with convulsive sobs, like the fitful gusts of a storm that is dying away; the costly
fabrics she wore--made sad mockery in their contrast with the pale, tear-stained, suffering
face. The hardest heart might have pitied her--yes, even the wholly ambitious heart of her
father, incensed as he was that a plebeian stranger of this land should have caused such distress.

When Christine awoke, her pride awoke also. With bitterness of spirit she recalled the events
of the past evening. But a new phase of feeling now began to manifest itself.

After her passionate outburst she was much calmer. In this respect the unimpeded flow of feeling
had done her good, and, as intimated, if kindness and sympathy could now have added their gentle
ministrations, she might have been the better for it all her life. But, left to herself, she
again yielded to the sway of her old and worst traits. Chief among these was pride; and under
the influence of this passion and the acute suffering of her unsoothed, unguided spirit, she
began to rebel in impotent anger. She grew hard, cynical, and reckless. Her father's lack of
sympathy and consideration alienated her heart even from him. Left literally alone in the world,
her naturally reserved nature shut itself up more closely than ever. Even her only friend,
Susie Winthrop, drifted away. One other, who might have been--But she could think of him only
with a shudder now. All the rest seemed indifferent, or censorious, or, worse still, to be
using her, like Mrs. Von Brakhiem and even her own father, as a stepping-stone to their personal
ambition. Christine could not see that she was to blame for this isolation. She did not understand
that cold, selfish natures, like her own and her father's, could not surround themselves with
warm, generous friends. She saw only the fact. But with flashing eyes she resolved that her
heart's secrets should not be pried into a hair-breadth further; that she would be used only
so far as she chose. She would, in short, "face out" the events of the past evening simply
and solely on the ground that she had not been well, and permit no questions to be asked.

Cold and self-possessed, she came down to a late breakfast. Mrs. Von Brakhiem, and others who
had been introduced, joined her, but nothing could penetrate through the nice polished armor
of her courteous reserve. Her father looked at her keenly, but she coolly returned his gaze.

When alone with her soon afterward, he turned and said, sharply, "What does all this mean?"

She looked around as if some one else were near.

"Were you addressing me?" she asked, coldly.

"Yes, of course I am," said her father, impatiently.

"From your tone and manner, I supposed you must be speaking to some one else."

"Nonsense! I was speaking to you. What does all this mean?"

She turned on him an indescribable look, and after a moment said in a slow, meaning tone, "Have
you not heard my explanation, sir?"

Such was her manner, he felt he could as easily strike her as say another word.

Muttering an oath, he turned on his heel and left her to herself.

The next morning her father bade her "Good-by." In parting he said, meaningly, "Christine, beware!"

Again she turned upon him that peculiar look, and replied in a low, firm tone: "That recommendation
applies to you, also. Let us both beware, lest we repent at leisure."

The wily man, skilled in character, was now thoroughly convinced that in his daughter he was
dealing with a nature very different from his wife's--that he was now confronted by a spirit
as proud and imperious as his own. He clearly saw that force, threatening, sternness would
not answer in this case, and that if he carried his points it must be through skill and cunning.
By some means he must ever gain her consent and co-operation.

His manner changed. Instinctively she divined the cause; and hers did not. Therefore father
and daughter parted as father and daughter ought never to part.

After his departure she was to remain at West Point till the season closed, and then accompany
Mrs. Von Brakhiem to New York, where she was to make as long a visit as she chose;--and she
chose to make a long one. In the scenery, and the society of the officers at West Point, and
the excitements of the metropolis, she found more to occupy her thoughts than she could have
done at Chicago. She went deliberately to work to kill time and snatch from it such fleeting
pleasures as she might.

They stayed in the country till the pomp and glory of October began to illumine the mountains,
and then (to Christine's regret) went to the city. There she entered into every amusement and
dissipation that her tastes permitted, and found much pleasure in frequent visits to the Central
Park, although it seemed tame and artificial after the wild grandeur of the mountains. It was
well that her nature was so high-toned that she found enjoyment in only what was refined or
intellectual. Had it been otherwise she might soon have taken, in her morbid, reckless state,
a path to swift and remediless ruin, as many a poor creature all at war with happiness and
truth has done. And thus in a giddy whirl of excitement (Mrs. Von Brakhiem's normal condition)
the days and weeks passed, till at last, thoroughly satiated and jaded, she concluded to return
home, for the sake of change and quiet, if nothing else. Mrs. Von Brakhiem parted with her
regretfully. Where would she find such another ally in her determined struggle to be talked
about and envied a little more than some other pushing, jostling votaries of fashion?

In languor or sleep Christine made the journey, and in the dusk of a winter's day her father
drove her to their beautiful home, which from association was now almost hateful to her. Still
she was too weary to think or suffer much. They met each other very politely, and their intercourse
assumed at once its wonted character of high-bred courtesy, though perhaps it was a little
more void of manifested sympathy and affection than before.

Several days elapsed in languid apathy, the natural reaction of past excitement; then an event
occurred which most thoroughly aroused her.

CHAPTER XXXVI

AN APPARITION

Mr. Ludolph had hoped to hear on his return that Dennis was dead. That would end all difficulties.
Mr. Schwartz did not know;--he was not at last accounts. Ernst was summoned. With a bright,
hopeful face he stated that his mother had just received a letter saying Dennis was a little
better. He was much surprised at his employer's heavy frown.

"He will live," mused Mr. Ludolph; "and now shall I permit him to return to my employ, or discharge
him?"

His brow contracted in lines of thought that suggested shrewdness, cunning, nothing manly,
and warily he judged.

"If I do not take him, he will go to Mr. French with certainty. He had better return, for then
both he and Christine will be more thoroughly under my surveillance.

"Curses on Christine's waywardness! There may be no resisting her, and my best chance will
be in managing him. This I could not do if he were in the store of my rival;" and so for unconscious
Dennis this important question was decided.

At last, as we have said, his delirium ceased, and the quiet light of reason came into his
eyes. He looked at his mother and smiled, but was too weak even to reach out his hand.

The doctor, coming in soon after, declared danger past, and that all depended now on good nursing.
Little fear of his wanting that!

"Ah, mine Gott be praised! mine Gott be praised!" exclaimed Mr. Bruder, who had to leave the
room to prevent an explosion of his grateful, happy feelings that might have proved too rude
a tempest for Dennis in his weak state. He was next seen striding across the fields to a neighboring
grove, ejaculating as he went. When he returned his eyes shone with a great peace and joy,
and he had evidently been with Him who had cast out the demon from his heart.

Day after day Dennis rallied. Unlike poor Christine, he had beneath him the two strongest levers,
love and prayer, and steadily they lifted him up to health and strength and comparative peace.
At last he was able to sit up and walk about feebly, and Mr. Bruder returned rejoicing to his
family. As he wrung Dennis's hand at parting, he said, in rather a hoarse voice: "If any von
tell me Gott is not goot and heareth not prayer, den I tell him he von grand heathen. Oh! but
we vill velcome you soon. Ve vill haf de grandest supper, de grandest songs, de grandest--"
but just here Mr. Bruder thought it prudent to pull his big fur cap over his eyes, and make
a rush for the stage.

As if by tacit understanding, Christine's name had not been mentioned during Dennis's recovery.
But one evening, after the little girls had been put to bed, and the lamp shaded, he sat in
the dimly lighted room, looking fixedly for a long time at the glowing embers. His mother was
moving quietly about, putting away the tea-things, clearing up after the children's play; but
as she worked she furtively watched him. At last coming to his side she pushed back the hair
that seemed so dark in contrast with the thin, white face and said, gently, "You are thinking
of Miss Ludolph, Dennis."

He had some blood yet, for that was not the glow of the fire that suffused his cheek; but he
only answered, quietly, "Yes, mother."

Do you think you can forget her?"

"I don't know."

"Prayer is a mighty thing, my son."

"But perhaps it is not God's will that I should ever win her," said Dennis, despondently.

"Then surely it is not yours, my child."

"No, mother," said Dennis, with bowed head and low tone, "but yet I am human and weak."

"You would still wish that it were His will?"

"Yes; I could not help it."

"But you would submit?"

"Yes, with His help I would," firmly.

"That is sufficient, my boy; I have such confidence in God that I know this matter will result
in a way to secure you the greatest happiness in the end."

But after a little time he sighed, wearily, "Yet how hard it is to wait till the great plan
is worked out!"

Braced by the stirring words of inspiration, strengthened by his mother's faith, he looked
up after a moment and said, earnestly, "At any rate I will try to be a man in your sense of
the word, and that is saying a great deal."

She beamed at him through her spectacles over her knitting-needles; and he thought, as he gazed
fondly at her, that in spite of her quaint, old-fashioned garb, and homely occupation, she
appeared more truly a saint than any painted on cathedral windows.

He soon noticed that his mother had grown feeble, and he determined to take her with him on
his return, believing that, by his care, and the wise use of tonics, he could restore her to
her wonted strength. His increased salary now justified the step.

Early in November his physician said he might return to business if he would be prudent. He
gladly availed himself of the permission, for he longed to be employed again.

The clerks all welcomed him warmly, for his good-nature had disarmed jealousy at his rapid
rise. But in the greeting of Mr. Ludolph he missed something of the cordiality he expected.

"Perhaps she has told him," thought he; and at once his own manner became tinged with a certain
coldness and dignity. He determined that both father and daughter should think of him only
with respect.

At the Bruders' the millennium came with Dennis. Metaphorically the fatted calf was killed;
their plain little room was trimmed with evergreens, and when he entered he was greeted by
such a jubilant, triumphant chorus of welcomes as almost took away his breath. What little
he had left was suddenly squeezed out of him; for Mrs. Bruden, dropping her frying-pan and
dish-cloth, rushed upon him, exclaiming, "Ah! mine fren! mine fren! De goot Gott be praised;"
and she gave him an embrace that made his bones ache.

Mr. Bruder stalked about the room repeating with explosive energy, like minute-guns, "Praise
Gott! Praise Gott!" Ernst, his great eyes dimmed with happy tears, clung to Dennis's hand,
as if he would make sure, by sense of touch as well as sight, that he had regained his beloved
teacher. The little Bruders were equally jubilant, though from rather mixed motives. Dennis's
arrival was very well, but they could not keep their round eyes long off the preparations for
such a supper as never before had blessed their brief career.

"Truly," thought Dennis, as he looked around upon the happy family, and contrasted its appearance
with that which it had presented when he first saw it, "my small investment of kindness and
effort in this case has returned large interest. I think it pays to do good."

The evening was one of almost unmingled happiness, even to his sore, disappointed heart, and
passed into memory as among the sunniest places of his life.

He found a pleasant little cottage over on the West side, part of which he rented for his mother
and sisters.

With Mr. Ludolph's permission he went after them, and installed them in it. Thus he had what
he had needed all along--a home, a resting-place for body and soul, under the watchful eye of love.

About this time Dr. Arten met him, stared a moment, then clapped him on the back in his hearty
way, saying, "Well, well, young man! you have cause to be thankful, and not to the doctors,
either."

"I think I am," said Dennis, smiling.

Suddenly the doctor looked grave, and asked in a stern voice, "Are you a heathen, or a good
Christian?"

"I hope not the former," replied Dennis, a little startled.

"Then don't go and commit suicide again. Don't you know flesh and blood can only stand so much?
When an intelligent young fellow like you goes beyond that, he is committing suicide. Bless
your soul, my ambitious friend, the ten commandments ain't all the law of God. His laws are
also written all over this long body of yours, and you came near paying a pretty penalty for
breaking them. You won't get off the second time."

"You are right, doctor; I now see that I acted very wrongly."

"'Bring forth fruits meet for repentance.' I am rich enough to give sound advice," said the
brusque old physician, passing on.

"Stop a moment, doctor," cried Dennis, "I want you to see my mother."

"What is the matter with her? She been breaking the commandments, too?"

"Oh, no!" exclaimed Dennis. "She is not a bit of a heathen."

"I am not so sure about that. I know many eminent saints in the church who will eat lobster
salad for supper, and then send for the doctor and minister before morning. There is a precious
twaddle about 'mysterious Providence.' Providence isn't half so mysterious as people make out.
The doctor is expected to look serious and sympathetic, and call their law-breaking and its
penalty by some outlandish Latin name that no one can understand. I give 'em the square truth,
and tell 'em they've been breaking the commandments."

Dennis could not forbear smiling at the doctor's rough handling of humbug, even in one of its
most respectable guises. Then, remembering his mother, he added, gravely: "I am truly anxious
about my mother, she has grown so feeble. I want, and yet dread, the truth."

The bantering manner of the good old doctor changed at once, and he said, kindly, "I'll come,
my boy, within a few days, though I am nearly run off my feet."

He went off, muttering, "Why don't the people send for some of the youngsters that sit kicking
up their heels in their offices all day?"

Dennis soon fell into the routine of work and rapidly grew stronger. But his face had acquired
a gravity, a something in expression that only experience gives, which made him appear older
by ten years. All trace of the boy had gone, and his countenance was now that of the man, and
of one who had suffered.

As soon as he recovered sufficient strength to act with decision, he indignantly tried to banish
Christine's image from his memory. But he found this impossible. Though at times his eyes would
flash, in view of her treatment, they would soon grow gentle and tender, and he found himself
excusing and extenuating, by the most special pleadings, that which he had justly condemned.

One evening his mother startled him out of a long revery, in which he had almost vindicated
Christine, by saying, "A very pleasant smile has been gradually dawning on your face, my son."

"Mother," replied he, hesitatingly, "perhaps I have judged Miss Ludolph harshly."

"Your love, not your reason, has evidently been pleading for her."

"Well, mother, I suppose you are right."

"So I suppose the Divine love pleads for the weak and sinful," said Mrs. Fleet, dreamily.

"That is a very pleasant thought, mother, for sometimes it seems that my love could make black
white."

"That the Divine love has done, but at infinite cost to itself."

"Oh that my love at any cost to itself could lead her into the new life of the believer!" said
Dennis, in a low, earnest tone.

"Your love is like the Divine in being unselfish, but remember the vital differences and take
heed. God can change the nature of the imperfect creature that He loves. You cannot. His love
is infinite in its strength and patience. You are human. The proud, selfish, unbelieving Miss
Ludolph (pardon mother's plain words) could not make you happy. To the degree that you were
loyal to God, you would be unhappy, and I should surely dread such a union. The whole tone
of your moral character would have to be greatly lowered to permit even peace."

"But, mother," said Dennis, almost impatiently, "in view of my unconquerable love, it is nearly
the same as if I were married to her now."

"No, my son, I think not. I know your pretty theory on this subject, but it seems more pretty
than true. Marriage makes a vital difference. It is the closest union that we can voluntarily
form on earth, and is the emblem of the spiritual oneness of the believer's soul with Christ.
We may be led through circumstances, as you have been, to love one with whom we should not
form such a union. Indeed, in the true and mystic meaning of the rite, you could not marry
Christine Ludolph. The Bible declares that man and wife shall be one. Unless she changes, unless
you change (and that God forbid), this could not be. You would be divided, separated in the
deepest essentials of your life here, and in every respect hereafter. Again, while God loves
every sinful man and woman, He does not take them to His heart till they cry out to Him for
strength to abandon the destroying evil He hates. There are no unchanged, unrenewed hearts
in heaven."

"Oh, mother, how inexorable is your logic!" said Dennis, breathing heavily.

"Truth in the end is ever more merciful than falsehood," she answered, gently.

After a little, he said, with a heavy sigh, "Mother, you are right, and I am very weak and
foolish."

She looked at him with unutterable tenderness. She could not crush out all hope, and so whispered,
as before: "Prayer is mighty, my child. It is not wrong for you to love. It is your duty, as
well as privilege, to pray for her. Trust your Heavenly Father, do His will, and He will solve
this question in the very best way."

Dennis turned to his mother in sudden and passionate earnestness, and said: "Your prayers are
mighty, mother, I truly believe. Oh, pray for her--for my sake as well as hers. Looking from
the human side, I am hopeless. It is only God's almighty power that can make us, as you say,
truly one. I fear that now she is only a heartless, fashionable girl. Yet, if she is only this,
I do not see how I came to love her as I do. But my trust now is in your prayers to God."

"And in your own also: the great Father loves you, too, my son. If He chooses that the dross
in her character should be burned away, and your two lives fused, there are in His providence
just the fiery trials, just the circumstances that will bring it about." (Was she unconsciously
uttering a prophecy?) "The crucible of affliction, the test of some great emergency, will often
develop a seemingly weak and frivolous girl into noble life, where there is real gold of latent
worth to be acted on."

"Christine Ludolph is anything but weak and frivolous," said he. "Her character is strong,
and I think most decided in its present bent. But as you say, if the Divine Alchemist wills
it, He can change even the dross to gold, and turn unbelief to faith."

Hope, Christine! There is light coming, though as yet you cannot see it. There are angels of
mercy flying toward you, though you cannot hear the rustle of their wings. The dark curtain
of death and despair can never shut down upon a life linked to heaven by such true, strong
prayer. And yet the logical results of wrong-doing will work themselves out, sin must be punished
and faith sorely tried.

Dennis heard incidentally that Christine was absent on a visit to New York, but he knew nothing
of the time of her return.

He now bent himself steadily and resolutely to the mastering of his business, and under Mr.
Bruder's direction resumed his art studies, though now in such moderation as Dr. Arten would
commend.

He also entered on an artistic effort that would tax his powers and genius to the very utmost,
of which more anon.

By the time Christine returned, he was quite himself again, though much paler and thinner than
when he first entered the store.

After Christine had been at home nearly a week, her father, to rouse her out of her listlessness,
said one morning: "We have recently received quite a remarkable painting from Europe. You will
find it in the upper show-room, and had better come down to-day to see it, for it may be sold
soon. I think you would like to copy one or two figures in it."

The lassitude from her New York dissipation was passing away, and her active nature beginning
to assert itself again. She started up and said, "Wait five minutes and I will get sketching
materials and go down with you."

By reason of her interdict, made at West Point, so earnestly, and indeed fiercely, and confirmed
by her manner, her father had never mentioned the name of Dennis Fleet. The very fact that
no one had spoken of him since that dreadful day when tidings came in on every side that he
could not live was confirmation in her mind that he was dead.

She dreaded going to the store, especially for the first time, for everything would irresistibly
remind her of him whom she could not think of now without a pang. But as the ordeal must come,
why, the sooner it was over the better. So a few moments later her hand was on her father's
arm, and they were on their way to the Art Building as in happier days.

Mr. Ludolph went to his office, and Christine, looking neither to the right nor to the left,
ascended to the upper show-room, and at once sought to engage every faculty in making the sketch
her father had suggested. Since Dennis was not, as she believed, either on the earth or elsewhere,
she tried to take up life again as it had been before he came, and to act as if he had never been.

Hopeless task! In that familiar place, where they had begun the rearrangement of the store,
everything spoke of him. She saw his glowing cheeks; again his dark, eager eyes followed her
every movement and interpreted her wishes even before she could speak. Some of the pictures
on the walls his hands had handled, and in her strong fancy his lithe form seemed moving the
ladder to take them down again, while she, with heart and mind at rest, looked with growing
curiosity and interest on her humble helper.

What changes had occurred within a short half-year! She shuddered at the thought that one who
was then so instinct with life and happiness could now be dust and nothingness, and she the cause.

Association and conscience were again too powerful. She was becoming nervous and full of a
strange unrest, so she concluded to finish her sketch at another time. As she was gathering
up her materials she heard some one enter the room.

She was in such a morbid, unstrung state that the least thing startled her. But imagine if
you can her wonder and terror as she saw Dennis Fleet--the dead and buried, as she fully believed--enter,
carrying a picture as of old, and looking as of old, save that he was paler and thinner. Was
it an apparition? or, as she had read, had she dwelt so long on this trouble that her mind
and imagination were becoming disordered and able to place their wild creations before her
as realities?

Her sketching materials fell clattering to the floor, and after one sharp exclamation of alarm
she stood as if transfixed, with parted lips and dilated eyes, panting like a frightened bird.

If a sculptor had wished to portray the form and attitude of one startled by the supernatural,
never could he have found a more fitting model than Christine at this moment.

As she had been seated a little on one side Dennis had not seen her at first; but, on recognizing
her so unexpectedly, he was scarcely less startled than she, and the valuable picture he was
carrying nearly met sudden destruction. But he had no such reason as Christine for the continuance
of his surprise, and, at once recovering himself, he set the picture against the wall.

This made the illusion still more strange and terrible to Christine. There was the dead before
her, doing just as she had been imagining--just what he had done at her bidding months before.

Dennis was greatly puzzled by her look of alarm and distress. Then he thought that perhaps
she feared he would break out in bitter and angry invectives again, and he advanced toward
her to assure her of the contrary.

Slowly and instinctively she retreated and put up her hands with a deprecatory gesture.

"She cannot endure the sight of me," thought he, but at once he said, with dignified courtesy:
"Miss Ludolph, you have nothing to fear from me, that you should regard me in that manner.
You need not shrink as if from contagion. We can treat each other as courteous strangers, at
least."

"I--I--I--thought you were dead!" she gasped, in a loud whisper.

Dennis's cheek grew paler than it had been in all his sickness, and then as suddenly became
dark with anger. His eyes were terrible in their indignation as he advanced a few paces almost
fiercely. She trembled violently and shrunk further away.

"You thought I was dead?" he asked, sternly.

"Ye-e-s," in the same unnatural whisper.

"What!" he exclaimed, in short and bitter emphasis, "do you mean to say that you never cared
even to ask whether I lived or died in my long, weary illness?--that you were so supremely
indifferent to my fate that you could not articulate one sentence of inquiry? Surely this is
the very sublimity of heartlessness; this is to be callous beyond one's power of imagination.
It seems to me that I would feel as much interest as that in any human being I had once known.
If even a dog had licked my hand in good-will, and afterward I had seen it, wounded or sick,
creep off into covert, the next time I passed that way I would step aside to see whether the
poor creature had lived or died. But after all the wealth of affection that I lavished upon
you, after toiling and almost dying in my vain effort to touch your marble heart, you have
not even the humanity to ask if I am above ground!"

The illusion had now passed from Christine's mind, and with it her alarm. The true state of
the case was rapidly dawning upon her, and she was about to speak eagerly; but in his strong
indignation he continued, impetuously: "You thought I was dead! The wish probably was father
to the thought. My presumption deserved no better fate. But permit me to tell you, though all
unbidden, I did not die. With God's blessing I expect to live to a good old age, and intend
that but few years shall pass before my name is as well known and honored as the ancient one
of Ludolph;" and he turned on his heel and strode from the room.

CHAPTER XXXVII

IF HE KNEW!

For a little time after Dennis's angry tread died away, Christine sat almost paralyzed by surprise
and deeper emotion. Her mind, though usually clear and rapid in its action, was too confused
to realize the truth. Suddenly she sprang up, gathered together her sketching materials, and
drawing a thick veil over her face sped through the store, through the streets, to the refuge
of her own room. She must be alone.

Hastily throwing aside her wrappings, she began to walk up and down in her excitement. Her
listlessness was gone now in very truth, and her eye and cheek glowed as never before. As if
it had become the great vivifying principle of her own life, she kept repeating continually
in a low, ecstatic tone, "He lives! he lives! he is not dead; his blood is not upon my conscience!"

At last she sat down in her luxurious chair before the window to think it all over--to commune
with herself--often the habit of the reserved and solitary. From the disjointed sentences she
let fall, from the reflection of her excited face in yonder glass, we gather quite correctly
the workings of her mind. Her first words were, "Thank heaven! thank something or other, I
have not blotted out that true, strong genius."

Again--"What untold wretchedness I might have saved myself if I had only asked the question,
in a casual way, 'How is Mr. Fleet?' Christine Ludolph, with all your pride and imagined superiority,
you can be very foolish.

"How he hates and despises me now! little wonder!"

"But if he knew!"

"Knew what? Why could you not ask after him, as after any other sick man? You have had a score
or so of offers, and did not trouble yourself as to the fate of the lovelorn swains. Seems
to me your conscience has been very tender in this case. And the fact that he misjudges you,
thinks you callous, heartless, and is angry, troubles you beyond measure."

"When before were you so sensitive to the opinion of clerks and trades-people, or even the
proudest suitors for your hand? But in this case you must cry out, in a tone of sentimental
agony, 'Oh, if he only knew I'"

"Knew what?"

Her face in yonder mirror has a strange, introverted expression, as if she were scanning her
own soul. Her brow contracts with thought and perplexity.

Gradually a warm, beautiful light steals into her face, transforming it as from the scowl of
a winter morning into a dawn of June; her eyes become gentle and tender. A rich color comes
out upon her cheeks, spreads up her temples, mantles her brow, and pours a crimson torrent
down her snowy neck. Suddenly she drops her burning face into her hands, and hides a vision
one would gladly look longer upon. But see, even her little ears have become as red as coral.

The bleakest landscape in the world brightens into something like beauty when the sun shines
upon it. So love, the richer, sweeter light of the soul, make the plainest face almost beautiful;
but when it changed Christine Ludolph's faultless, yet too cold and classical, features into
those of a loving woman's, it suggested a beauty scarcely human.

A moment later there came a faint whisper: "I fear--I almost fear I love him." Then she lifted
a startled, frightened face and looked timidly around as if, in truth, walls had ears.

Reassured by the consciousness of solitude, her head dropped on her wrist and her revery went
forward. Her eyes became dreamy, and a half-smile played upon her lips as she recalled proof
after proof of his affection, for she knew the cruel words of the last interview were the result
of misunderstanding.

But suddenly she darted from her seat and began pacing the room in the strongest perturbation.

"Mocked again!" she cried; "the same cruel fate! my old miserable experience in a new aspect!
With everything within my reach, save the one thing I want, I possess the means of all kinds
of happiness except that which makes me happy. In every possible way I am pledged to a career
and future in which he can take no part. Though my heart is full of the strangest, sweetest
chaos, and I do not truly understand myself, yet I am satisfied that this is not a school-girl's
fancy. But my father would regard it as the old farce repeated. Already he suspects and frowns
upon the matter. I should have to break with him utterly and forever. I should have to give
up all my ambitious plans and towering hopes of life abroad. A plain Mrs. in this city of shops
is a poor substitute for a countess's coronet and a villa on the Rhine."

Her cheek flushed, and her lip curled.

"That indeed would be the very extravagance of romance, and how could I, least of all, who
so long have scoffed at such things, explain my action? These mushroom shopkeepers, who were
all nobodies the other day, elevate their eyebrows when a merchant's daughter marries her father's
clerk. But when would the wonder cease if a German lady of rank followed suit?

"Then again my word, my honor, every sacred pledge I could give, forbids such folly.

"Would to heaven I had never seen him, for this unfortunate fancy of mine must be crushed in
its inception; strangled before it comes to master me as it has mastered him."

After a long and weary sigh she continued: "Well, everything is favorable for a complete and
final break between us. He believes me heartless and wicked to the last degree. I cannot undeceive
him without showing more than he should know. I have only to avoid him, to say nothing, and
we drift apart.

"If we could only have been friends he might have helped me so much! but that now is clearly
impossible--yes, for both of us.

"Truly one of these American poets was right:

"'For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these--It might have been.'

"But thanks to the immortal gods, as the pious heathen used to say, his blood is not on my
hands, and this has taken a mountain off my heart. Thus relieved I can perhaps forget all the
miserable business. Fate forbids that I, as it has forbidden that many another high-born woman,
should marry where she might have loved."

If Christine's heart was wronged, her pride was highly gratified by this conclusion. Here was
a new and strong resemblance between herself and the great. In mind she recalled the titled
unfortunates who had "loved where they could not marry," and with the air and feeling of a
martyr to ancestral grandeur she pensively added her name to the list.

With her conscience freed from its burden of remorse, with the knowledge, so sweet to every
woman, that she might accept this happiness if she would, in spite of her airs of martyrdom,
the world had changed greatly for the better, and with the natural buoyancy of youth she reacted
into quite a cheerful and hopeful state.

Her father noticed this on his return to dinner in the evening, and sought to learn its cause.
He asked, "How did you make out with your sketch?"

"I made a beginning," she answered, with some little color rising to her cheek.

"Perhaps you were interrupted?"

"Why did you not tell me that Mr. Fleet had recovered?" she asked, abruptly.

"Why, did you think he was dead?"

"Yes."

Mr. Ludolph indulged in a hearty laugh (he knew the power of ridicule).

"Well, that is excellent!" he said. "You thought the callow youth had died on account of your
hardness of heart; and this explains your rather peculiar moods and tenses of late. Let me
assure you that a Yankee never dies from such a cause."

Mr. Ludolph determined if possible to break down her reserve and let in the garish light, which
he knew to be most fatal to all romantic fancies, that ever thrive best in the twilight of
secrecy. But she was on the alert now, and in relief of mind had regained her poise and the
power to mask her feeling. So she said in a tone tinged with cold indifference, "You may be
right, but I had good reason to believe to the contrary, and, as I am not altogether without
a conscience, you might have saved much pain by merely mentioning the fact of his recovery."

"But you had adjured me with frightful solemnity never to mention his name again," said her
father, still laughing.

Christine colored and bit her lip. She had forgotten for the moment this awkward fact.

"I was nervous, sick, and not myself that day, and every one I met could speak of nothing but
Mr. Fleet."

"Well, really," he said, "in the long list of the victims that you have wounded if not slain,
I never supposed my clerk and quondam man-of-all-work would prove so serious a case."

"A truce to your bantering, father! Mr. Fleet is humble only in station, not in character,
not in ability. You know I have never been very tender with the 'victims,' as you designate
them, of the Mellen stamp; but Mr. Fleet is a man, in the best sense of the word, and one that
I have wronged. Now that the folly is past I may as well explain to you some things that have
appeared strange. I think I can truly say that I have given those gentlemen who have honored,
or rather annoyed me, by their unwished-for regard, very little encouragement. Therefore, I
was not responsible for any follies they might commit. But for artistic reasons I did encourage
Mr. Fleet's infatuation. You remember how I failed in making a copy of that picture. In my
determination to succeed, I hit upon the rather novel expedient of inspiring and copying the
genuine thing. You know my imitative power is better than my imagination, and I thought that
by often witnessing the expression of feeling and passion, I might learn to portray it without
the disagreeable necessity of passing through any such experiences myself. But the experiment,
as you know, did not work well. These living subjects are hard to manage, and, as I have said,
I am troubled by a conscience."

Mr. Ludolph's eyes sparkled, and a look of genuine admiration lighted up his features.

"Brava!" he cried; "your plan was worthy of you and of your ancestry. It was a real stroke
of genius. You were too tender-hearted, otherwise it would have been perfect. What are the
lives of a dozen such young fellows compared with the development and perfection of such a
woman as you bid fair to be?"

Christine had displayed in this transaction just the qualities that her father most admired.
But even she was shocked at his callousness, and lifted a somewhat startled face to his.

"Your estimate of human life is rather low," she said.

"Not at all. Is not one perfect plant better than a dozen imperfect ones? The gardener often
pulls up the crowding and inferior ones to throw them about the roots of the strongest, that
in their death and decay they may nourish it to the highest development. The application of
this principle is evident. They secure most in this world who have the skill and power to grasp
most."

"But how about the rights of others? Conscious men and women are not plants."

"Let them be on their guard then. Every one is for himself in this world. That can be plainly
seen through the thin disguises that some try to assume. After all, half the people we meet
are little better than summer weeds."

Christine almost shuddered to think that the one bound to her by closest ties cherished such
sentiments toward the world, and probably, to a certain extent, toward herself, but she only
said, quietly: "I can hardly subscribe to your philosophy as yet, though I fear I act upon
it too often. Still it does not apply to Mr. Fleet. He is gifted in no ordinary degree, and
doubtless will stand high here in his own land in time. And now, as explanation has been made,
with your permission we will drop this subject out of our conversation as before."

"Well," said Mr. Ludolph to himself, between sips of his favorite Rhine wine, "I have gained
much light on the subject to-night, and I must confess that, even with my rather wide experience,
the whole thing is a decided novelty. If Christine were only less troubled with conscience,
over-fastidiousness, or whatever it is--if she were more moderate in her ambition as an artist,
and could be satisfied with power and admiration, as other women are--what a star she might
become in the fashionable world of Europe! But, for some reason, I never feel sure of her.
Her spirit is so wilful and obstinate, and she seems so full of vague longing after an ideal,
impossible world, that I live in constant dread that she may be led into some folly fatal to
my ambition. This Fleet is a most dangerous fellow. I wish I were well rid of him; still, matters
are not so bad as I feared--that is, if she told me the whole truth, which I am inclined to
doubt. But I had better keep him in my employ during the few months we still remain in this
land, as I can watch over him, and guard against his influence better than if he were beyond
my control. But no more promotion or encouragement does he get from me."

Janette, Christine's French maid, passed the open door. The thought struck Mr. Ludolph that
he might secure an ally in her.

The unscrupulous creature was summoned, and agreed for no very large sum to become a spy upon
Christine, and report anything looking toward friendly relations with Dennis Fleet.

"The game is still in my hands," said the wary man. "I will yet steer my richly-freighted argosy
up the Rhine. Here's to Christine, the belle of the German court!" and he filled a slender
Venetian glass to the brim, drained it, and then retired.

Christine, on reaching her room, muttered to herself: "He now knows all that I mean he ever
shall. We are one in our ambition, if nothing else, and therefore our relations must be to
a certain degree confidential and amicable. And now forget you have a conscience, forget you
have a heart, and, above all things, forget that you have ever seen or known Dennis Fleet."

Thus the influence of a false education, a proud, selfish, ambitious life, decided her choice.
She plunged as resolutely into the whirl of fashionable gayety about her as she had in the
dissipations of New York, determined to forget the past, and kill the time that must intervene
before she could sail away to her brilliant future in Germany.

But she gradually learned that, if conscience had robbed her of peace before, something else
disturbed her now, and rendered her efforts futile. Probably each sense gives comparatively few
elementary sensations, and many blends or compounds of these elements. To identify the elements
is by no means a simple task, for under ordinary circumstances what we get is a compound, and it
is only by carefully controlling the stimulus that we are able to
get the elements before us; and even then the question whether these
are really elementary sensations can scarcely be settled by direct
observation.

Along with the search for elementary sensations goes identification of the stimuli that arouse them,
and also a study of the sensations aroused by any combination of stimuli. Our task now will
be to ask these questions regarding each of the senses.

The Skin Senses

Rough and smooth, hard and soft, moist and dry, hot and cold, itching, tickling, pricking, stinging,
aching are skin sensations; but some of these are almost certainly compounds. The most successful
way of isolating the elements out of these compounds is to explore the skin, point by point, with
weak stimuli of different kinds. If a blunt metal point, or the point of a lead pencil, a few
degrees cooler than the skin, is passed slowly over the skin, at most points no sensation except
that of contact arises, but at certain points there is a clear sensation of cold. Within an
area an inch square on the back of the hand, several of these cold
spots can be found; and when the exploration is carefully made, and
the cold spots marked, they will be found to give the same sensation
every time.

Substitute a metal point a few {198} degrees warmer than the skin, and a few spots will be found that
give the sensation of warmth, these being the warmth spots. Use a sharp point, like that of
a needle or of a sharp bristle, pressing it moderately against the skin, and you get at most
points simply the sensation of contact, but at quite a number of points a small, sharp pain sensation
arises. These are the pain spots.

Finally, if the skin is explored with a hair of proper length and thickness, no sensation at all
will be felt at most points, because the hair bends so readily when one end of it is pressed against
the skin as not to exert sufficient force to arouse a sensation; but a number of points are found
where a definite sensation of touch or contact is felt; these are
the touch spots. By reason of a trait peculiar to Christine, this was only the more stimulating.
She craved all the more that which was seemingly denied.

Accustomed to every gratification, to see all yield to her wishes, and especially to find gentlemen
almost powerless to resist her beauty, she came to regard this one stern, averted face as infinitely
more attractive than all the rest in the world.

"That he so steadily avoids me proves that he is anything but indifferent," she said to herself
one day.

She condemned her visits to the store, and often reproached herself with folly in going; but
a secret powerful magnetism drew her thither in spite of herself.

Dennis, too, soon noticed that she came often, and the fact awakened a faint hope within him.
He learned that his love was not dead, but only chilled and chained by circumstances and his
own strong will. True, apart from the fact of her coming, she gave him no encouragement. She
was as distant and seemingly oblivious of his existence as he of hers, but love can gather
hope from a marvellously little thing.

But one day Christine detected her father watching her movements with the keenest scrutiny,
and after that she came more and more rarely. The hope that for a moment had tinged the darkness
surrounding Dennis died away like the meteor's transient light.

He went into society very little after his illness, and shunned large companies. He preferred
to spend his evenings with his mother and in study. The Winthrops were gone, having removed
to their old home in Boston, and he had not formed very intimate acquaintances elsewhere. Moreover,
his limited circle, though of the best and most refined, was not one in which Christine often
appeared.

But one evening his cheek paled and his heart fluttered as he saw her entering the parlors
of a lady by whom he had been invited to meet a few friends. For some little time he studiously
avoided her, but at last his hostess, with well-meant zeal, formally presented him.

They bowed very politely and very coldly. The lady surmised that Christine did not care about
the acquaintance of her father's clerk, and so brought them no more together. But Christine
was pained by Dennis's icy manner, and saw that she was thoroughly misunderstood. When asked
to sing, she chose a rather significant ditty:

    "Ripple, sparkle, rapid stream,
     Let your dancing wavelets gleam
     Quiveringly and bright;
     Children think the surface glow
     Reaches to the depth below,
     Hidden from the light.

    "Human faces often seem
     Like the sparkle of the stream,
     In the social glare;
     Some assert, in wisdom's guise,
     (Look they not with children's eyes?)
     All is surface there."

As she rose from the piano her glance met his with something like meaning in it, he imagined.
He started, flushed, and his face became full of eager questioning. But her father was on the
watch also, and, placing his daughter's hand within his arm, he led her into the front parlor,
and soon after they pleaded another engagement and vanished altogether.

No chance for explanation came, and soon a new and all-absorbing anxiety filled Dennis's heart,
and the shadow of the greatest sorrow that he had yet experienced daily drew nearer.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE GATES OPEN

At Dennis's request, Dr. Arten called and carefully inquired into Mrs. Fleet's symptoms. Her
son stood anxiously by awaiting the result of the examination. At last the physician said,
cheerily: "There is no immediate occasion for alarm here. I am sorry to say that your mother's
lungs are far from strong, but they may carry her through many comfortable years yet. I will
prescribe tonics, and you may hope for the best. But mark this well, she must avoid exposure.
A severe cold might be most serious in its consequences."

How easy to say, "Do not take cold!" How many whose lives were at stake have sought to obey
the warning, but all in vain! Under Dr. Arten's tonics, Mrs. Fleet grew stronger, and Dennis
rejoiced over the improvement. But, in one of the sudden changes attendant on the breaking
up of winter, the dreaded cold was taken, and it soon developed into acute pneumonia.

For a few days she was very ill, and Dennis never left her side. In the intervals of pain and
fever she would smile at him and whisper: "The harbor is near. This rough weather cannot last
much longer."

"Mother, do not leave us; we cannot spare you," ever pleaded her son.

Contrary to her expectations, however, she rallied, but continued in a very feeble state. Dennis
was able to resume his duties in the store, and he hoped and tried to believe that the warm
spring and summer days soon to come would renew his mother's strength. But every day she grew
feebler, and Dr. Arten shook his head.

The Bruders were very kind, and it was astonishing how much Mrs. Bruder, though burdened with
her large family, found time to do. If Mrs. Fleet had been her own mother she could not have
bestowed upon her more loving solicitude. Mr. Bruder was devotion itself. He removed his easel
to an attic-room in Mrs. Fleet's house; and every hour of Dennis's absence heard him say: "Vat
I do for you now? I feel no goot unless I do someding."

Some little time after Mrs. Fleet was taken sick a mystery arose. The most exquisite flowers
and fruits were left at the house from time to time, marked in a bold, manly hand, "For Mrs.
Fleet." But all efforts to discover their source failed.

The reader will guess that Christine was the donor, and Dennis hoped it--though, he admitted
to himself, with little reason.

Mrs. Fleet had not much pain. She seemed gently wafted as by an ebbing tide away from time
and earth, Kindly but firmly she sought to prepare Dennis's mind for the change soon to take
place. At first he could not endure its mention, but she said, earnestly: "My son, I am not
dying. I am just entering on the true, real, eternal life--a life which is as much beyond this
poor feeble existence as the sun is brighter than a glow-worm. I shall soon clasp my dear husband
to my heart again, and, oh, ecstasy! I shall soon in reality see the Saviour whom I now see
almost continually in vision."

Then again she would turn toward her earthly treasures with unutterable yearning and tenderness.

"Oh, that I could gather you up in my arms and take you all with me!" she would often exclaim.
Many times during the day she would call the little girls from their play and kiss their wondering
faces.

One evening Dennis came home and found a vase of flowers with a green background of mint at
his mother's bedside. Their delicate fragrance greeted him as soon as he entered. As he sat
by her side holding her hand, he said, softly: "Mother, are not these sprays of mint rather
unusual in a bouquet? Has the plant any special meaning? I have noticed it before mingled with
these mysterious flowers."

She smiled and answered, "When I was a girl its language was, 'Let us be friends again.'"

"Do you think--can it be possible that she sends them?" said he, in a low, hesitating tone.

"Prayer is mighty, my son."

"And have you been praying for her all this time, mother?"

"Yes, and will continue to do so to the last."

"Oh, mother! I have lost hope. My heart has been full of bitterness toward her, and I have
felt that God was against it all."

"God is not against her learning to know Him, which is life. Jesus has loved her all the time,
and she has wronged Him more than she has you."

Dennis bowed his head on his mother's hand, and she felt hot tears fall upon it. At last he
murmured: "You are indeed going to heaven soon, dear mother, for your language is not of earth.
When will such a spirit dwell within me?"

"Again remember your mother's words," she answered, gently; "prayer is mighty."

"Mother," said he, with a sudden earnestness, "do you think you can pray for us in heaven?"

"I know of no reason to the contrary."

"Then I know you will, and the belief will ever be a source of hope and strength."

Mrs. Fleet was now passing through the land of Beulah. To her strong spiritual vision, the
glories of the other shore seemed present, and at times she thought that she really heard music;
again it would seem as if her Saviour had entered the plain little room, as He did the humble
home at Bethany.

Her thoughts ran much on Christine. One day she wrote, feebly:

"Would Miss Ludolph be willing to come and see a dying woman?
                                  ETHEL FLEET."

Mr. Bruder carried it, but most unfortunately Christine was out, so that her maid, ever on
the alert to earn the price of her treachery, received it. It was slightly sealed. She opened
it, and saw from its contents that it must be given to Mr. Ludolph. He with a frown committed
it to the flames.

"I have written to her," she whispered to her son in the evening, "and think she will come
to see me."

Dennis was sleepless that night, through his hope and eager expectation. The following day,
and the next passed, and she came not.

"I was right," exclaimed he, bitterly. "She is utterly heartless. It was not she who sent the
flowers. Who that is human would have refused such a request! Waste no more thought upon her,
for she is unworthy, and it is all in vain." "No!" said Mrs. Fleet in sudden energy. "It is
not in vain. Have I not prayed again and again? and shall I doubt God?"

"Your faith is stronger than mine," he answered, in deep despondency.

"God's time is not always ours," she answered, gently.

But an angry fire lurked in Dennis's eyes, and he muttered to himself as he went to his room:
"She has snapped the last slender cord that bound me to her. I could endure almost anything
myself, but that she should refuse to visit my dying mother proves her a monster, with all
her beauty."

As he was leaving the house in the morning, his mother whispered, gently, "Who was it that
said, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what they do?'"

"Ah, but she does know," said he, bitterly. "I can forgive nearly everything against myself,
but not slights to you."

"The time will come when you will forgive everything, my son."

"Not till there is acknowledgment and sorrow for the wrong," answered he, sternly. Then with
a sudden burst of tenderness he added: "Good-by, darling mother. I will try to do anything
you wish, even though it is impossible;" but his love, through Janette's treachery, suffered
the deepest wound it had yet received.

Christine of her own accord had almost decided to call upon Mrs. Fleet, but before she could
carry out her purpose while hastily coming downstairs one day, she sprained her ankle, and
was confined to her room some little time.

She sent Janette with orders for the flowers, who, at once surmising their destination, said
to the florist that she was Miss Ludolph's confidential maid, and would carry them to those
for whom they were designed. He, thinking it "all right," gave them to her, and she took them
to a Frenchman in the same trade whom she knew, and sold them at half-price, giving him a significant
sign to ask no questions. To the same market she brought the fruit; so from that time they
ceased as mysteriously as they had appeared at Mrs. Fleet's bedside.

But Dennis was so anxious, and his mother was now failing so rapidly, that he scarcely noted
this fact. The warm spring days seemed rather to enervate than to strengthen her. He longed
to stay with her constantly, but his daily labor was necessary to secure the comforts needful
to an invalid. Every morning he bade her a most tender adieu, and during the day often sent
Ernst to inquire how she was.

One evening Christine ventured to send Janette on the same errand and impatiently awaited her
return. At last she came, appearing as if flushed and angry.

"Whom did you see?" asked Christine, eagerly.

"I saw Mr. Fleet himself."

"Well, what did he say?"

"He bite his lip, frown, and say, 'Zere is no answer,' and turn on his heel into ze house."

It was now Christine's turn to be angry. "What!" she exclaimed, "does his Bible teach him to
forget and forgive nothing? Can it be that he, like the rest of them, believes and acts on
only such parts as are to his mood?"

"I don't know nothing about him," said the maid, "only I don't want to go zere again."

"You need not," was the brief reply.

After a long, bitter revery, she sighed: "Ah, well, thus we drift apart. But it is just as
well, for apart we must ever be."

One morning early in May Mrs. Fleet was very weak, and Dennis left her with painful misgivings.
During the morning he sent Ernst to see how she was, and he soon returned, with wild face,
crying, "Come home quick!"

Breaking abruptly from his startled customer, Dennis soon reached his mother's side. Mr. and
Mrs. Bruder were sobbing at the foot of the bed, and the girls were pleading piteously on either
side--"Oh, mother! please don't go away!"

"Hush!" said Dennis, solemnly. Awed by his manner, all became comparatively silent. He bent
over the bed, and said, "Mother, you are leaving us."

The voice of her beloved son rallied the dying woman's wandering mind. After a moment she recognized
him, smiled faintly, and whispered: "Yes, I think I am--kiss me--good-by. Bring--the children.
Jesus--take care--my little--lambs. Good-by--true--honest friends--meet me--heaven. Dennis--these
children--your charge--bring them home--to me. Pray for her. I don't know--why--she seems very--near
to me. Farewell--my good--true--son--mother's blessing--God's blessing--ever rest--on you."

Her eyes closed, and she fell into a gentle sleep.

"She vake no more in dis vorld," said Mrs. Bruder, in an awed tone.

Mr. Bruder, unable to control his feelings any longer, hurried from the room. His wife, with
streaming eyes, silently dressed the little girls, and took them home with her, crying piteously
all the way for mamma.

Pale, tearless, motionless, Dennis sat, hour after hour holding his mother's hand. He noted
that her pulse grew more and more feeble. At last the sun in setting broke through the clouds
that had obscured it all day, and filled the room with a sudden glory.

To Dennis's great surprise, his mother's eyes opened wide, with the strange, far-off look they
ever had when she was picturing to herself the unknown world.

Her lips moved. He bent over her and caught the words: "Hark! hear!--It never was so sweet
before. See the angels--thronging toward me--they never came so near before."

Then a smile of joy and welcome lighted up her wan features, and she whispered, "Oh, Dennis,
husband--are we once more united?"

Suddenly there was a look of ecstasy such as her son had never seen on any human face, and
she cried almost aloud, "Jesus--my Saviour!" and received, as it were, directly into His arms,
she passed from earth.

We touch briefly on the scenes that followed. Dennis took the body of his mother to her old
home, and buried it under the wide-spreading elm in the village churchyard, where as a happy
child and blooming maiden she had often sat between the services. It was his purpose to remove
the remains of his father and place them by her side as soon as he could afford it.

His little sisters accompanied him east, and he found a home for them with a sister of his
mother, who was a good, kind, Christian lady. Dennis's salary was not large, but sufficient
to insure that his sisters would be no burden to his aunt, who was in rather straitened circumstances.
He also arranged that the small annuity should be paid for their benefit.

It was hard parting from his sisters, whose little hearts seemed breaking at what appeared
to them to be a new bereavement.

"How can I leave them!" he exclaimed, with tears falling fast from his eyes.

"They are children," said his aunt, soothingly, "and will forget their troubles in a few days."

And so it proved; but Dennis, with a sore heart, and feeling very lonely, returned to Chicago.

When at last Christine got out again, she learned from Ernst at the store that Dennis's mother
had died, and that he had taken the remains and his sisters east. In his sorrow he seemed doubly
interesting to her.

"How I wish it were in my power to cheer and comfort him!" she sighed, "and yet I fear my ability
to do this is less than that of any one else. In very truth he seems to despise and hate me
now. The barriers between us grow stronger and higher every day. How different it all might
have been if--. But what is the use of these wretched 'ifs'? What is the use of resisting this
blind, remorseless fate that brings happiness to one and crushes another?"

Wearily and despondingly she rode back to the elegant home in which she found so little enjoyment.

Whom should she met there but Mrs. Von Brakhiem from New York, bound westward with a gay party
on a trip to the Rocky Mountains and California? They had stopped to spend a few days in Chicago,
and were determined to take Christine on with them. Her father strongly seconded the plan.
Though Christine surmised his motive, she did not care to resist. Since she would soon be separated
from Dennis forever, the less she saw of him the less would be the pain. Moreover, her sore
and heavy heart welcomed any change that would cause forgetfulness; and so it was speedily
arranged.

Mrs. Von Brakhiem and her party quite took possession of the Ludolph mansion, and often made
it echo with gayety.

On the evening of the day that Dennis buried his mother, Ernst went over at Mr. Ludolph's request
to carry a message. He found the house the scene of a fashionable revel. There were music and
dancing in the parlors, and from the dining-room the clink of glasses and loud peals of laughter
proved that this was not Christine's ideal of an entertainment as she had portrayed it to her
father on a former occasion. In truth, she had little to do with the affair; it was quite impromptu,
and Mr. Ludolph and Mrs. Von Brakhiem were responsible for it.

But Ernst could not know this, and to him it seemed shocking. The simple funeral service taking
place on that day in the distant New England village had never been absent from his thoughts
a moment. Since early morning he had gone about with his little face composed to funereal gravity.

His simple, warm-hearted parents felt that they could only show proper respect for the occasion
by the deepest gloom. Their rooms were arranged in stiff and formal manner, with crape here
and there. All unnecessary work ceased, and the children, forbidden to play, were dressed in
mourning as far as possible, and made to sit in solemn and dreadful state all day. It would
not have surprised Ernst if the whole city had gone into mourning. Therefore the revelry at
the Ludolph mansion seemed to him heartless and awful beyond measure, and nearly the first
things he told Dennis on the latter's return was that they had had "a great dancing and drinking
party, the night of the funeral, at Mr. Ludolph's." Then, trying to find some explanation for
what seemed to him such a strange and wicked thing, he suggested, "Perhaps they meant it for
a wake."

Poor little Ernst's ideas of the world, outside of his home, had been gathered from a very
low neighborhood.

He also handed Dennis a letter that Mr. Ludolph requested should be given him on his return.
It read as follows:

                              "CHICAGO, May 6, 1871.

"I have been compelled to supply your place in your absence: therefore
your services will be no longer needed at this store. Inclosed you
will find a check for the small balance still due you,
                                AUGUST LUDOLPH."

Dennis's brow grew very dark, and in bitter soliloquy he said, half aloud, as he strode up
and down his little room in great agitation: "And so it all ends! The girl at whose side my
mother would have watched in the most dangerous and loathsome of diseases; the woman of ice
whom I sought to melt and render human by as warm, true love as ever man lavished on one who
rewarded his affection--this beautiful monster will not even visit my mother when dying; she
holds a revel on the day of the funeral; and now, through her influence no doubt, I am robbed
of the chance of winning honest bread. She cannot even endure the sight of the man who once
told her the unvarnished truth. Poor as you deem me, Christine Ludolph, with God's help not
many years shall pass before it will be condescension on my part to recognize you."

He would not even go to the store again. The Bruders, having heard what had occurred, took
Ernst away also; but Dennis soon found him a better situation elsewhere.

The day on which Dennis returned, Christine was speeding in a palace-car toward the Rocky Mountains,
outwardly gay, determined to enjoy herself and carry out her reckless purpose to get the most
possible out of life, cost what it might.

If she had been a shallow girl, thoughtless and vain, with only mind enough to take in the
events of the passing moment, she might have bought many fleeting pleasures with her abundant
wealth. But this she was not, with all her faults, and wherever she went, in the midst of gayest
scenes, and in the presence of the grandest and most inspiring scenery, thought and memory,
like two spectres that no spell could lay, haunted her and robbed her of peace and any approach
to happiness. Though possessing the means of gratifying every whim, though restrained by no
scruples from doing what she chose, she felt that all around were getting more from life than she.

During her absence she experienced a sudden and severe attack of illness. Her friends were
much alarmed about her, and she far more about herself. All her old terror returned. In one
respect she was like her mother; she had no physical courage, but shrank with inexpressible
dread from danger, pain, and death. Again the blackness of darkness gathered round her, and
not one in the gay pleasure party could say a word to comfort her.

She recovered, and soon regained her usual health, but her self-confidence was more thoroughly
shaken. She felt like one in a little cockle-shell boat out upon a shoreless ocean. While the
treacherous sea remained calm, all might be well, but she knew that a storm would soon arise,
and that she must go down, beyond remedy. Again she had been taught how suddenly, how unexpectedly,
that storm might rise.

Dennis resolved at once to enter on the career of an artist. He sold to Mr. French, at a moderate
price, some paintings and sketches he had made. He rented a small room that became his studio,
sleeping-apartment--in brief, his home, and then went to work with all the ordinary incentives
to success intensified by his purpose to reach a social height that would compel Christine
to look upward if their acquaintance were renewed.

Disappointment in love is one of the severest tests of character in man or woman. Some sink
into weak sentimentality, and mope and languish; some become listless, apathetic, and float
down the current of existence like driftwood. Men are often harsh and cynical, and rail at
the sex to which their mothers and sisters belong. Sometimes a man inflicts a wellnigh fatal
wound and leaves his victim to cure it as best she may. From that time forth she may be like
the wronged Indian, who slays as many white men as he can. Not a few, on finding they cannot
enter the beautiful paradise of happy love, plunge into imbruting vice, and drown not only
their disappointment but themselves in dissipation. Their course is like that of some who deem
that the best way to cure a wound or end a disease is to kill the patient as soon as possible.
If women have true metal in them (and they usually have) they become unselfishly devoted to
others, and by gentle, self-denying ways seek to impart to those about them the happiness denied
to themselves.

But with all manly young men the instinct of Dennis is perhaps the most common. They will rise,
shine, and dazzle the eyes that once looked scornfully or indifferently at them.

As he worked patiently at his noble calling this smaller ambition was gradually lost in the
nobler, broader one, to be a true artist and a good man.

During his illness some gentlemen of large wealth and liberality, who wished to stimulate and
develop the native artistic talent of their city, offered a prize of two thousand dollars for
the finest picture painted during the year, the artist also having the privilege of selling
his work.

On his return after his illness Dennis heard of this, and determined to be one of the competitors.
He applied to Mr. Cornell, who had the matter in charge, for permission to enter the lists,
which that gentleman granted rather doubtfully. He had known Dennis only as a critic, not as
an artist. But having gained his point, Dennis went earnestly to work on the emblematic painting
he had resolved upon, and with what success the following chapters will show.

His mother's sickness and death, of course, put a complete shop to his artistic labors for
a time, but when entering on his new career, he gave himself wholly to this effort.

The time for exhibition and decision was fixed--Saturday morning October 7, 1871.

CHAPTER XXXIX

SUSIE WINTHROP APPEARS AGAIN

Our story passes rapidly over the scenes and events of the summer and fall of '71. Another
heavy blow fell upon Dennis in the loss of his old friend and instructor, Mr. Bruder.

By prayer and effort, his own and others, he was saved morally and spiritually, but he had
been greatly shattered by past excess. He was attacked by typhoid fever, and after a few days'
illness died. Recovery from this disease depends largely upon strength and purity of constitution.
But every one of the innumerable glasses of liquor that poor Bruder had swallowed had helped
to rob him of these, and so there was no power to resist.

Under her husband's improved finances, Mrs. Bruder had removed to comfortable lodgings in Harrison
Street, and these she determined to keep if possible, dreading for the sake of her children
the influences of a crowded tenement house. Dennis stood by her, a stanch and helpful friend;
Ernst was earning a good little sum weekly, and by her needle and washtub the patient woman
continued the hard battle of life with fair prospects of success.

Dennis's studio was on the south side, at the top of a tall building overlooking the lake.
Even before the early summer sun rose above the shining waves he was at his easel, and so accomplished
what is a fair day's work before many of his profession had left their beds. Though he worked
hard and long, he still worked judiciously. Bent upon accomplishing what was almost impossible
within the limited time remaining, he determined that, with all his labor, Dr. Arten should
never charge him with suicidal tendencies again. Therefore he trained himself mentally and
morally for his struggle as the athlete trains himself physically.

He believed in the truth, too little recognized among brain-workers, that men can develop themselves
into splendid mental conditions, wherein they can accomplish almost double their ordinary amount
of labor.

The year allotted to the competitors for the prize to be given in October was all too short
for such a work as he had attempted, and through his own, his mother's, and Mr. Bruder's illness,
he had lost a third of the time, but in the careful and skilful manner indicated he was trying
to make it up. He had a long conversation with shrewd old Dr. Arten, who began to take a decided
interest in him. He also read several books on hygiene. Thus he worked under the guidance of
reason, science, Christian principle, instead of mere impulse, as is too often the case with
genius.

In the absorption of his task he withdrew utterly from society, and, with the exception of
his mission class, Christian worship on the Sabbath, and attendance on a little prayer-meeting
in a neglected quarter during the week, he permitted no other demands upon his time and thoughts.

His pictures had sold for sufficient to provide for his sisters and enable him to live, with
close economy, till after the prize was given, and then, if he did not gain it (of which he
was not at all sure), his painting would sell for enough to meet future needs.

And so we leave him for a time earnestly at work. He was like a ship that had been driven hither
and thither, tempest-tossed and in danger. At last, under a clear sky and in smooth water,
it finds its true bearings, and steadily pursues its homeward voyage.

The Christine whom he had first learned to love in happy unconsciousness, while they arranged
the store together, became a glorified, artistic ideal. The Christine whom he had learned to
know as false and heartless was now to him a strange, fascinating, unwomanly creature, beautiful
only as the Sirens were beautiful, that he might wreck himself body and soul before her unpitying
eyes. He sought to banish all thought of her.

Christine returned about midsummer. She was compelled to note, as she neared her native city,
that of all the objects it contained Dennis Fleet was uppermost in her thoughts. She longed
to go to the store and see him once more, even though it should be only at a distance, with
not even the shadow of recognition between them. She condemned it all as folly, and worse than
vain, but that made no difference to her heart, which would have its way.

Almost trembling with excitement she entered the Art Building the next day, and glanced around
with a timidity that was in marked contrast to her usual cold and critical regard. But, as
the reader knows, Dennis Fleet was not to be seen. From time to time she went again, but neither
he nor Ernst appeared. She feared that for some reason he had gone, and determined to learn
the truth. Throwing off the strange timidity and restraint that ever embarrassed her where
he was concerned, she said to Mr. Schwartz one day: "I don't like the way that picture is hung.
Where is Mr. Fleet? I believe he has charge of that department."

"Why, bless you! Miss Ludolph," replied Mr. Schwartz, with a look of surprise, "Mr. Ludolph
discharged him over two months ago."

"Discharged him! what for?"

"For being away too much, I heard," said old Schwartz, with a shrug indicating that that might
be the reason and might not.

Christine came to the store but rarely thereafter, for it had lost its chief element of interest.
That evening she said to her father, "You have discharged Mr. Fleet?"

"Yes," was the brief answer.

"May I ask the reason?"

"He was away too much."

"That is not the real reason," she said, turning suddenly upon him. "Father, what is the use
of treating me as a child? What is the use of trying to lock things up and keep them from me?
I intend to go to Germany with you this fall, and that is sufficient."

With a courtly smile Mr. Ludolph replied, "And I have lived long enough, my daughter, to know
that what people intend, and what they do are two very different things."

She flushed angrily and said: "It was most unjust to discharge him as you did. Do you not remember
that he offered his mother's services as nurse when I was dreading the smallpox?"

"You are astonishingly grateful in this case," said her father, with a meaning that Christine
understood too well; "but, if you will read the records of the Ludolph race, you will find
that its representatives have often been compelled to do things somewhat arbitrarily. Since
you have been gone, I have received letters announcing the death of my brother and his wife.
I am now Baron Ludolph!"

But Christine was too angry and too deeply wounded to note this information, which at one time
would have elated her beyond measure. She coldly said, "It is a pity that noblemen are compelled
to aught but noble deeds"; and, with this parting arrow, she left him.

Even her father winced, and then with a heavy frown said, "It is well that this Yankee youth
has vanished; still, the utmost vigilance is required."

Again he saw the treacherous maid and promised increased reward if she would be watchful, and
inform him of every movement of Christine.

In the unobtrusive ways that her sensitive pride permitted, Christine tried to find out what
had become of Dennis, but vainly. She offered her maid a large reward if she would discover
him, but she had been promised a larger sum not to find him, and so did not. The impression
was given that he had left the city, and Christine feared, with a sickening dread, that she
would never see him again. But one evening Mr. Cornell stated a fact in a casual way that startled
both Mr. and Miss Ludolph.

He was calling at their house, and they were discussing the coming exhibition of the pictures
which would compete for the prize.

"By the way, your former clerk and porter is among the competitors; at least he entered the
lists last spring, but I have lost sight of him since. I imagine he has given it up, and betaken
himself to tasks more within the range of his ability."

The eyes of father and daughter met, but she turned to Mr. Cornell, and said, coolly, though
with a face somewhat flushed, "And has Chicago so much artistic talent that a real genius has
no chance here?"

"I was not aware that Mr. Fleet was a genius," answered Mr. Cornell.

"I think that he will satisfy you on that point, and that you will hear from him before the
exhibition takes place."

Mr. Ludolph hastily changed the subject, but he had forebodings as to the future.

Christine went to her room, and thought for a long time; suddenly she arose, exclaiming, "He
told me his story once on canvas; I will now tell him mine."

She at once stretched the canvas on a frame for a small picture, and placed it on an easel,
that she might commence with dawn of day.

During the following weeks she worked scarcely less earnestly and patiently than Dennis. The
door was locked when she painted, and before she left the studio the picture was hidden.

She meant to send it anonymously, so that not even her father should know its authorship. She
hoped that Dennis would recognize it.

When she was in the street her eyes began to have an eager, wistful look, as if she was seeking
some one. She often went to galleries, and other resorts of artists, but in vain, for she never
met him, though at times the distance between them was less than between Evangeline and her
lover, when she heard the dip of his oar in her dream. Though she knew that if she met him
she would probably give not one encouraging glance, yet the instinct of her heart was just
as strong.

Mr. Ludolph told the maid that she must find out what Christine was painting, and she tried
to that degree that she wakened suspicion.

On one occasion Christine turned suddenly on her, and said: "What do you mean? If I find you
false--if I have even good reason to suspect you--I will turn you into the street, though it
be at midnight!"

And the maid learned, as did Mr. Ludolph, that she was not dealing with a child.

During Monday, October 2, Dennis was employed all the long day in giving the finishing touches
to his picture. It was not worked up as finely as he could have wished; time did not permit
this. But he had brought out his thought vividly, and his drawings were full of power. On the
following Saturday the prize would be given.

In the evening he walked out for air and exercise. As he was passing one of the large hotels,
he heard his name called. Turning, he saw on the steps, radiant with welcome, his old friend,
Susie Winthrop. Her hand was on the arm of a tall gentleman, who seemed to have eyes for her
only. But in her old impulsive way she ran down the steps, and gave Dennis a grasp of the hand
that did his lonely heart good. Then, leading him to the scholarly-looking gentleman, who was
gazing through his glasses in mild surprise, she said: "Professor Leonard, my husband, Mr.
Fleet. This is the Dennis Fleet I have told you about so often."

"Oh-h," said the professor, in prolonged accents, while a genial light shone through his gold
spectacles. "Mr. Fleet, we are old acquaintances, though we have never met before. If I were
a jealous man, you are the only one I should fear."

"And we mean to make you wofully jealous to-night, for I intend to have Mr. Fleet dine with
us and spend the evening. Wo, I will take no excuse, no denial. This infatuated man will do
whatever I bid him, and he is a sort of Greek athlete. If you do not come right along I shall
command him to lay violent hands on you and drag you ignominiously in."

Dennis was only too glad to accept, but merely wished to make a better toilet.

"I have just come from my studio," he said.

"And you wish to go and divest yourself of all artistic flavor and become commonplace. Do you
imagine I will permit it? No! so march in as my captive. Who ever heard of disputing the will
of a bride? This man" (pointing up to the tall professor) "never dreams of it."

Dennis learned that she was on her wedding trip, and saw that she was happily married, and
proud of her professor, as he of her.

With feminine tact she drew his story from him, and yet it was but a meagre, partial story,
like the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out, for he tried to be wholly silent on his love
and disappointment. But in no respect did he deceive Mrs. Leonard. Her husband went away for
a little time. In his absence she asked, abruptly, "Have you seen Miss Ludolph lately?"

"No!" said Dennis, with a tell-tale flush. Seeing her look of sympathy, and knowing her to
be such a true friend, the impulsive young man gave his confidence almost before he knew it.
She was just the one to inspire trust, and he was very lonely, having had no one to whom he
could speak his deeper feelings since his mother died.

"Miss Ludolph wronged me in a way that a man finds it hard to forget or forgive," he said,
in a low, bitter tone; "but I should have tried to do both had she not treated my mother most
inhumanly;" and he told his story over again with Hamlet in.

Mrs. Leonard listened with breathless interest, and then said: "She is a strange girl, and
that plan of making you her unconscious model is just like her, though it was both cruel and
wicked. And yet Mr. Fleet, with shame for my sex I admit it, how many would have flirted with
you to the same degree from mere vanity and love of excitement! I have seen Miss Ludolph, and
I cannot understand her. We are no longer the friends we once were, but I cannot think her
utterly heartless. She is bent upon becoming a great artist at any cost, and I sometimes think
she would sacrifice herself as readily as any one else for this purpose. She looks to me as
if she had suffered, and she has lost much of her old haughty, cold manner, save when something
calls it out. Even in the drawing-room she was abstracted, as if her thoughts were far away.
You are a man of honor, and it is due that you should know the following facts. Indeed I do
not think that they are a secret any longer, and at any rate they will soon be known. If Mr.
Ludolph were in Germany he would be a noble. It is his intention to go there this fall, and
take his wealth and Christine with him, and assert his ancestral titles and position. Christine
could not marry in this land without incurring her father's curse, and I think she has no disposition
to do that--her ambition is fully in accord with his."

"Yes," said Dennis, bitterly, "and where other women have hearts, she has ambition only."

The professor returned and the subject was dropped.

Dennis said, on taking his leave: "I did not expect to show any one my picture till it was
placed on exhibition with the others, but, if you care to see it, you may to-morrow. Perhaps
you can make some suggestions that will help me."

They eagerly accepted the invitation, and came the following morning. Dennis watched them with
much solicitude. When once they understood his thought, their delight and admiration knew no
bounds. The professor turned and stared at him as if he were an entirely different person from
the unpretending youth who had been introduced on the preceding evening.

"If you do not get the prize," he said, sententiously, "you have a great deal of artistic talent
in Chicago."

"'A Daniel come to judgment!'" cried his wife.

CHAPTER XL

SUGGESTIVE PICTURES AND A PRIZE

At last the day of the exhibition dawned. Dennis had sent his picture, directed to Mr. Cornell,
with his own name in an envelope nailed to its back. No one was to know who the artists were
till after the decision was given. Christine had sent hers also, but no name whatever was in
the envelope attached to it.

At an early hour, the doors were thrown open for all who chose to come. The committee of critics
had ample time given them for their decision, and at one o'clock this was to be announced.

Although Dennis went rather early, he found that Christine was there before him. She stood
with Professor and Mrs. Leonard, Mr. Cornell, and her father, before his picture, fie could
only see her side face, and she was glancing from the printed explanation in the catalogue
to the painting. Mrs. Leonard was also at her side, seeing to it that no point was unnoted.
Christine's manner betrayed intense interest and excitement, and with cause, for again Dennis
had spoken to her deepest soul in the language she best loved and understood.

As before, she saw two emblematic pictures within one frame merely separated by a plain band
of gold.

The first presented a chateau of almost palatial proportions, heavy, ornate, but stiff and
quite devoid of beauty. It appeared to be the abode of wealth and ancestral greatness.

Everything about the place indicated lavish expenditure. The walks and trees were straight
and formal, the flowers that bloomed here and there, large and gaudy. A parrot hung in a gilded
cage against a column of the piazza. No wild songsters fluttered in the trees, or were on the
wing. Hills shut the place in and gave it a narrow, restricted appearance, and the sky overhead
was hard and brazen. On the lawn stood a graceful mountain ash, and beneath it were two figures.
The first was that of a man, and evidently the master of the place. His appearance and manner
chiefly indicated pride, haughtiness, and also sensuality. He had broken a spray from the ash-tree,
and with a condescending air was in the act of handing it to a lady, in the portraiture of
whom Dennis had truly displayed great skill. She was very beautiful, and yet there was nothing
good or noble in her face. Her proud features showed mingled shame and reluctance to receive
the gift in the manner it was bestowed, and yet she was receiving it. The significance of the
mountain ash is "Grandeur." The whole scene was the portrayal, in the beautiful language of
art, of a worldly, ambitious marriage, where the man seeks mere beauty, and the woman wealth
and position, love having no existence.

It possessed an eloquence that Christine could not resist, and she fairly loathed the alliance
she knew her father would expect her to make after their arrival in Germany, though once she
had looked forward to it with eagerness as the stepping-stone to her highest ambition.

The second picture was a beautiful contrast. Instead of the brazen glare of the first, the
air was full of glimmering lights and shades, and the sky of a deep transparent blue. Far up
a mountain side, on an overhanging cliff, grew the same graceful ash-tree, but its branches
were entwined with vines of the passion-flower that hung around in slender streamers. On a
jutting rock, with precarious footing, stood a young man reaching up to grasp a branch, his
glance bold and hopeful, and his whole manner full of daring and power. He had evidently had
a hard climb to reach his present position; his hat was gone; his dress was light and simple
and adapted to the severest effort.

But the chief figure in this picture also was that of a young girl who stood near, her right
hand clasping his left, and steadying and sustaining him in his perilous footing. The wind
was in her golden hair, and swept to one side her light, airy costume. Her pure, noble face
was lilted up toward him, rather than toward the spray he sought to grasp, and an eager, happy
light shone from her eyes. She had evidently climbed with him to their present vantage-point,
and now her little hand secured and strengthened him as he sought to grasp, for her, success
and prosperity joined with unselfish love. The graceful wind-flowers tossed their delicate
blossoms around their feet, and above them an eagle wheeled in its majestic flight.

Below and opposite them on a breezy hillside stood a modern villa, as tasteful in its architecture
as the former had been stiff and heavy. A fountain played upon the lawn, and behind it a cascade
broke into silver spray and mist. High above this beautiful earthly home, in the clear, pure
air rose a palace-like structure in shadowy, golden outline, indicating that after the dwelling-place
of time came the grander, the perfect mansion above.

Christine looked till her eyes were blinded with tears, and then dropped her veil. In the features
of the lady in each case she had not failed to trace a faint likeness, sufficient to make it
clear to herself. She said in a low, plaintive tone, with quivering lips, "Mr. Fleet painted
that picture."

"Yes," said Mrs. Leonard, looking at her with no little wonder and perplexity.

By a great effort Christine recovered herself and said, "You know how deeply fine paintings
always affect me."

Dennis of course knew nothing of Christine's feelings. He could only see that his picture had
produced a profound effect on her, and that she had eyes for nothing else. But he overheard
Mr. Cornell say, "It is indeed a remarkable painting"

"Do you know its author?" asked Mr. Ludolph, with a heavy frown.

"No, I do not. It is still a mystery"

"Will it take the prize, do you think?"

"I am not at liberty to give an opinion as yet," replied Mr. Cornell, with a smile. "There
is another picture here, almost if not quite as fine, though much smaller and simpler;" and
he took Mr. Ludolph off to show him that.

Dennis was now recognized by Mrs. Leonard and her husband, who came forward and greeted him
cordially, and they started on a tour of the gallery together. Though his heart beat fast,
he completely ignored Christine's presence, and responded coldly to Mr. Ludolph's slight bow.

Christine, on being aware of his presence, furtively devoured him with her eyes. The refining
influences of his life were evident in his face and bearing, and she realized her ideal of
what a man ought to be. Eagerly she watched till he should discover her painting where it hung
opposite his own, and at last she was amply rewarded for all her toil. He stopped suddenly
and stood as if spellbound.

The picture was very simple, and few accessories entered into it. Upon a barren rock of an
island stood a woman gazing far out at sea, where in the distance a ship was sailing away.
Though every part had been worked up with exquisite finish, the whole force and power of the
painting lay in the expression of the woman's face, which was an indescribable mingling of
longing and despair. Here also Christine had traced a faint resemblance to herself, though
the woman was middle-aged and haggard, with famine in her cheeks.

As Dennis looked and wondered, the thought flashed into his mind, "Could she have painted that?"
He turned suddenly toward her and was convinced that she had done so; for she was looking at
him with something of the same expression, or at least he fancied so. She blushed deeply and
turned hastily away. He was greatly agitated, but in view of the eyes that were upon him controlled
himself and remained outwardly calm.

Mr. Ludolph also was convinced that his daughter had painted the picture, and he frowned more
heavily than before. He turned a dark look on her, and found her regarding Dennis in a manner
that caused him to grind his teeth with rage. But he could only sit down and watch the course
of events.

The people were now thronging in. The gentlemen who made up the prize, with their committee
of award, of which Mr. Cornell was chairman, were also present. Most critically they examined
each picture till at last their choice narrowed down to the two paintings above described.
But it soon became evident that their choice would fall upon the larger one, and Dennis saw
that he was to be the victor. To his surprise Christine seemed utterly indifferent as to the
result of their decision. He could not know that the prize had no place in her thoughts when
she painted her picture. She had found her reward in its effect on him.

At one o'clock Mr. Cornell came forward and said: "Ladies and gentlemen, and especially do
I address that group of liberal citizens who are so generously seeking to encourage art in
our great and prosperous city, it gives me pleasure to inform you that your munificence has
brought forth rich fruit, for here are many paintings that would do credit to any gallery.
We hesitated a little time between two very superior pictures, but at last we have decided
that the larger one is worthy of the prize. The smaller picture is one of great merit; its
treatment is unusually fine, though the subject is not new.

"The two emblematic pictures in some parts show crude and hasty work; indeed some minor parts
are quite unfinished. The artist evidently has not had sufficient time. But the leading features
are well wrought out, and the power and originality of the entire effort so impress us that,
as I have said, we render our decision in its favor. That all may know our verdict to be fair,
we state on our honor that we do not know by whom a single painting present was executed. Dr.
Arten, as the largest contributor toward the prize, you are appointed to bestow it. On the
back of the picture you will find an envelope containing the name of the artist, whom we all
shall delight to honor."

Amid breathless expectation, Dr. Arten stepped forward, took down the envelope, and read in
a loud, trumpet-voice--

"DENNIS FLEET."

CHAPTER XLI

FIRE! FIRE!

"Will Dennis Fleet come forward?" cried Dr. Arten. Very pale, and trembling with excitement,
Dennis stepped out before them all.

"Take heart, my young friend; I am not about to read your death-warrant," said the doctor,
cheerily. "Permit me to present you with this check for two thousand dollars, and express to
you what is of more value to the true artist, our esteem and appreciation of your merit. May
your brush ever continue to be employed in the presentation of such noble, elevating thoughts."

And the good doctor, quite overcome by this unusual flight of eloquence, blew his nose vigorously
and wiped from his spectacles the moisture with which his own eyes had bedewed them.

Dennis responded with a low bow, and was about to retire; but his few friends, and indeed all
who knew him, pressed forward with their congratulations.

Foremost among these were the professor and his wife. Tears of delight fairly shone in Mrs.
Leonard's eyes as she shook his hand again and again. Many others also trooped up for an introduction,
till he was quite bewildered by strange names, and compliments that seemed stranger still.

Suddenly a low, well-known voice at his side sent a thrill to his heart and a rush of crimson
to his face.

"Will Mr. Fleet deign to receive my congratulations also?"

He turned and met the deep blue eyes of Christine Ludolph lifted timidly to his. But at once
the association that had long been uppermost in regard to her--the memory of her supposed treatment
of his mother--flashed across him, and he replied, with cold and almost stately courtesy, "The
least praise or notice from Miss Ludolph would be a most unexpected favor."

She thought from his manner that he might as well have said "unwelcome favor," and with a sad,
disappointed look she turned away.

Even in the excitement and triumph of the moment, Dennis was oppressed by the thought that
he had not spoken as wisely as he might. Almost abruptly he broke away and escaped to the solitude
of his own room.

He did not think about his success. The prize lay forgotten in his pocketbook. He sat in his
arm-chair and stared apparently at vacancy, but in reality at the picture that he was sure
Christine had painted. He went over and over again with the nicest scrutiny all her actions
in the gallery, and now reproached himself bitterly for the repelling answer he had given when
she spoke to him. He tried to regain his old anger and hardness in view of her wrongs to him
and his, but could not. The tell-tale picture, and traces of sorrow and suffering in her face
in accord with it, had disarmed him. He said to himself, and half believed, that he was letting
his imagination run away with his reason, but could not help it. At last he seized his hat
and hastened to the hotel where Mrs. Leonard was staying. Because we want them.

We want candy, because we like the sweet taste; but we like a cold drink because and when we are
thirsty and not otherwise. Thirst is a want for water, a state of the organism that impels
us to drink; and when we are in this state, we like a drink, a drink is pleasant then. How
absurd it would be to say that we were thirsty because we liked to
drink! when the fact is that we like to drink because we are thirsty.

The desire to drink must first be aroused, and then drinking is pleasant.

What

is true of thirst is true of hunger, or of any organic need. The need must first be aroused, and
then its satisfaction is pleasant. This applies just as well to fighting, laughing, fondling
a baby, and to all the instincts. My friend,
you had better forget her. They sail for Europe very soon; and, besides, she is not worthy of you."

"I only wish I could forget her, and am angry with myself but I cannot," he replied, and soon
after said "good-night."

Wandering aimlessly through the streets, he almost unconsciously made his way to the north
side, where the Ludolph mansion was situated. Then a strong impulse to Go to it came over him,
and for the first time since the far-off day when, stunned and wounded by his bitter disappointment,
he had gone away apparently to die, he found himself at the familiar place. The gas was burning
in Mr. Ludolph's library. He went around on the side street (for the house was on a corner),
and a light shone from what he knew to be Christine's studio. She undoubtedly was there. Even
such proximity excited him strangely, and in his morbid state he felt that he could almost
kiss the feeble rays that shimmered out into the darkened street. In his secret soul he utterly
condemned his folly, but promised himself that he would be weak no longer after that one night.
The excitements of the day had thrown him off his balance.

Suddenly he heard, sweet and clear, though softened by distance and intervening obstacles,
the same weird, pathetic ballad that had so moved him when Christine sang it at Le Grand Hotel,
on the evening after he had pointed out the fatal defect in her picture. At short intervals,
kindred and plaintive songs followed.

"There is nothing exultant or hopeful about those strains," he said to himself. "For some reason
she is not happy. Oh, that I might have one frank conversation with her and find out the whole
truth! But it seems that I might just as well ask for a near look at yonder star that glimmers
so distantly. For some reason I cannot believe her so utterly heartless as she has seemed;
and then mother has prayed. Can it all end as a miserable dream?"

Late at night the music ceased, and the room was darkened.

Little dreamed Christine that her plaintive minstrelsy had fallen on so sympathetic an ear,
and that the man who seemingly had repelled her slightest acquaintance had shivered long hours
in the cold, dark street.

So the divine Friend waits and watches, while we, in ignorance and unbelief, pay no heed. Stranger
far, He waits and watches when we know, but yet, unrelenting, ignore His presence.

With heavy steps, Dennis wearily plodded homeward. He was oppressed by that deep despondency
which follows great fatigue and excitement.

In the southwest he saw a brilliant light. He heard the alarm-bells, and knew there was a fire,
but to have aroused him that night it must have come scorchingly close. He reached his dark
little room, threw himself dressed on the couch, and slept till nearly noon of the next day.

When he awoke, and realized how the first hours of the Sabbath had passed, he started up much
vexed with himself, and after a brief retrospect said: "Such excitements as those of yesterday
are little better than a debauch, and I must shun them hereafter. God has blessed and succeeded
me, and it is but a poor return I am making. However my unfortunate attachment may end, nothing
is gained by moping around in the hours of night. Henceforth let there be an end of such folly."

He made a careful toilet and sat down to his Sabbath-school lesson.

To his delight he again met Mrs. Leonard, who came to visit her old mission class. She smiled
most approvingly, and quoted, "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
in much."

He went home with her, and in the evening they all went to church together.

He cried unto the Lord for strength and help, and almost lost consciousness of the service
in his earnest prayer for true manhood and courage to go forward to what he feared would be
a sad and lonely life. And the answer came; for a sense of power and readiness to do God's
will, and withal a strange hopefulness, inspired him. Trusting in the Divine strength, he felt
that he could meet his future now, whatever it might be.

Again the alarm-bells were ringing, and there was a light on the southwest.

"There seems to be a fire over there in the direction of my poor German friend's house. You
remember Mrs. Bruder. I will go and call on them, I think. At any rate I should call, for it
is owing to her husband that I won the prize;" and they parted at the church-door.

Christine had left the picture-gallery soon after Dennis's abrupt departure. Her gay friends
had tried in vain to rally her, and rather wondered at her manner, but said, "She is so full
of moods of late, you can never know what to expect."

Her father, with a few indifferent words, left her for his place of business. His hope still
was to prevent her meeting Dennis, and to keep up the estrangement that existed.

Christine went home and spent the long hours in bitter revery, which at last she summed up
by saying, "I have stamped out his love by my folly, and now his words, 'I despise you,' express
the whole wretched truth." Then clenching her little hands she added, with livid lips and a
look of scorn: "Since I can never help him (and therefore no one) win earthly greatness, I
will never be the humble recipient of it from another. Since his second picture cannot be true
of my experience, neither shall the first."

And she was one to keep such a resolve. The evening was spent, as we know, in singing alone
in her studio, this being her favorite, indeed her only way, of giving expression to her feelings.
Very late she sought her bed to find but little sleep.

The day of rest brought no rest to her, suggested no hope, no sacred privilege of seeking Divine
help to bear up under life's burdens. To her it was a relic of superstition, at which she chafed
as interfering with the usual routine of affairs. She awoke with a headache, and a long miserable
day she found it. Sabbath night she determined to have sleep, and therefore took an opiate
and retired early.

Mr. Ludolph sat in his library trying to construct some plan by which Christine could be sent
to Germany at once.

When Dennis reached the neighborhood of the fire he found it much larger than he supposed,
and when he entered Harrison Street, near Mrs. Bruder's home, he discovered that only prompt
action could save the family. The streets were fast becoming choked with fugitives and teams,
and the confusion threatened to develop into panic and wide spread danger. The fire was but
a block away when he rushed upstairs to the floor which the Bruders occupied. From the way
in which blazing brands were flying he knew that there were was not a moment to spare.

He found Mrs. Bruder startled, anxious, but in no way comprehending the situation.

"Quick!" cried Dennis. "Wake and dress the children--pack up what you can lay your hands on
and carry--you have no time to do anything more."

"Ah! mine Gott! vat you mean?"

"Do as I say--there's no time to explain. Here, Ernst, help me;" and Dennis snatched up one
child and commenced dressing it before it could fairly wake. Ernst took up another and followed
his example. Mrs. Bruder, recovering from her bewilderment, hastily gathered a few things together,
saying in the meantime, "Surely you don't dink our home burn up?"

"Yes, my poor friend, in five minutes more we must all be out of this building."

"Oh, den come dis minute! Let me save de schilder;" and, throwing a blanket around the youngest,
the frightened woman rushed downstairs, followed by Ernst and his little brother, while Dennis
hastened with the last child and the bundle.

Their escape was none too prompt, for the blazing embers were falling to such a degree in the
direct line of the fire as to render that position very perilous. But though their progress
was necessarily slow, from the condition of the streets, the breadth of the fire was not great
at this spot, and they soon reached a point to the west and windward that was safe. Putting
the family in charge of Ernst, and telling them to continue westward, Dennis rushed back, feeling
that many lives depend upon stout hands and brave hearts that night. Moreover he was in that
state of mind which made him court rather than shun danger.

He had hardly left his humble friends before Mrs. Bruder stopped, put her hand on her heart
and cried: "Oh, Ernst! Oh, Gott forgive me! dot I should forget him--your fader's picture.
I must go back."

"Oh, moder, no! you are more to us than the picture" The woman's eyes were wild and excited,
and she cried, vehemently: "Dot picture saved mine Berthold life--yes, more, more, him brought
back his artist soul. Vithout him ve vould all be vorse dan dead. I can no live vidout him.
Stay here"; and with the speed of the wind the devoted wife rushed back to the burning street,
up the stairs, already crackling and blazing, to where the lovely landscape smiled peacefully
in the dreadful glare, with its last rich glow of beauty. She tore it from its fastenings,
pressed her lips fervently against it, regained the street, but with dress on fire. She staggered
forward a few steps in the hot stifling air and smoke, and then fell upon her burden. Spreading
her arms over it, to protect it even in death, the mother's heart went out in agony toward
her children.

"Ah, merciful Gott! take care of dem," she sighed, and the prayer and the spirit that breathed
it went up to heaven together.

CHAPTER XLII

BARON LUDOLPH LEARNS THE TRUTH

With eyes ablaze with excitement, Dennis plunged into the region just before the main line
of fire, knowing that there the danger would be greatest. None realized the rapidity of its
advance. At the door of a tenement-house he found a pale, thin, half-clad woman tugging at
a sewing-machine.

"Madam," cried Dennis, "you have no time to waste over that burden if you wish to escape."

"What is the use of escaping without it?" she answered, sullenly. "It is the only way I have
of making a living."

"Give it to me then, and follow as fast as you can." Shouldering what meant to the poor creature
shelter, clothing, and bread, he led the way to the southeast, out of the line of fire. It
was a long, hard struggle, but they got through safely.

"How can I ever pay you?" cried the grateful woman.

But he did not stay to answer, and now determined to make his way to the west and windward
of the fire, as he could then judge better of the chances of its spreading. He thought it safer
to go around and back of the flames, as they now seemed much wider, and nearer the south branch
of the Chicago River.

He found that he could cross the burned district a little to the southwest, for the small wooden
houses were swept so utterly away that there were no heated, blazing ruins to contend with.
He also saw that he could do better by making quite a wide circuit, as he thus avoided streets
choked by fugitives. Beaching a point near the river on the west side of the fire, he climbed
a high pile of lumber, and then discovered to his horror that the fire had caught in several
places on the south side, and that the nearest bridges were burning.

To those not familiar with the topography of the city, it should be stated that it is separated
by the Chicago River, a slow, narrow stream, into three main divisions, known as the south,
the north, and the west side.

By a triumph of engineering, the former mouth of this river at the lake is now its source,
the main stream being turned back upon itself, and dividing into two branches at a point a
little over half a mile from the lake, one flowing to the southwest into the Illinois, and
the other from the northwest into the main stream.

The south division includes all the territory bounded on the east by the lake, on the north
by the main river and on the west by the south branch. The north division includes the area
bounded on the east by the lake, on the south by the main river, and on the west by the north
branch, while the west division embraces all that part of the city west of the two branches.
The fire originated in De Koven Street, the southeastern part of the west side, and it was
carried steadily to the north and east by an increasing gale. The south side, with all its
magnificent buildings, was soon directly in the line of the fire. 

The axons of the sensory nerve divide into fine branches in the sense organ, and thus are more easily
aroused by the stimulus.

Besides the sensory axons, two other things are often found in a sense
organ--sometimes one of the two, sometimes the other and sometimes
both. He plunged in with the rest, and soon found himself hustled hither and thither
by a surging mass of humanity. A little piping voice that seemed under his feet cried: "O mamma!
mamma! Where are you? I'm gettin' lost."

"Here I am, my child," answered a voice some steps in advance and Dennis saw a lady carrying
another child; but the rushing tide would not let her wait--all, in the place where they were
wedged, being carried right along. Stooping down, he put the little girl on his shoulder where
she could see her mother, and so they pressed on. Suddenly, in the very midst of the tunnel,
the gas ceased, by reason of the destruction of the works, and utter darkness filled the place.

There was a loud cry of consternation, and then a momentary and dreadful silence, which would
have been the preface of a fatal panic, had not Dennis cried out, in a ringing voice, "All
keep to the right!"

This cry was taken up and repeated on every hand, and side by side, to right and left, the
two living streams of humanity, with steady tramp! tramp! rushed past each other.

When they emerged into the glare of the south side Dennis gave the child to its mother and
said, "Madam, your only chance is to escape in that direction," pointing northwest.

He then tried to make his way to the hotel where Professor and Mrs. Leonard were staying, but
it was in the midst of an unapproachable sea of fire. If they had not escaped some little time
before, they had already perished. He then tried to make his way to the windward toward his
own room. His two thousand dollars and all his possessions were there, and the instinct of
self-preservation caused him to think it was time to look after his own. But progress was now
very difficult. The streets were choked by drays, carriages, furniture, trunks, and every degree
and condition of humanity. Besides, his steps were often stayed by thrilling scenes and the
need of a helping hand. In order to make his way faster he took a street nearer the fire, from
which the people had mostly been driven. As he was hurrying along with his hat drawn over his
eyes to avoid the sparks that were driven about like fiery hail, he suddenly heard a piercing
shriek. Looking up he saw the figure of a woman at the third story window of a fine mansion
that was already burning, though not so rapidly as those in the direct line of the fire. He
with a number of others stopped at the sound.

"Who will volunteer with me to save that woman?" cried he.

"Wal, stranger, you can reckon on this old stager for one," answered a familiar voice.

Dennis turned and recognized his old friend, the Good Samaritan.

"Why, Cronk," he cried, "don't you know me? Don't you remember the young man you saved from
starving by suggesting the snow-shovel business?"

"Hello! my young colt. How are you? give us yer hand. But come, don't let's stop to talk about
snow in this hell of a place with that young filly whinnying up there."

"Right!" cried Dennis. "Let us find a ladder and rope; quick--"

At a paint-shop around the corner a ladder was found that reached to the second story, and
some one procured a rope.

"A thousand dollars," cried another familiar voice, "to the man who saves that woman!"

Looking round, Dennis saw the burly form of Mr. Brown, the brewer, his features distorted by
agony and fear; then glancing up he discovered in the red glare upon her face that the woman
was no other than his daughter. She had come to spend the night with a friend, and, being a
sound sleeper, had not escaped with the family.

"Who wants yer thousand dollars?" replied Bill Cronk's gruff voice. "D'ye s'pose we'd hang
out here over the bottomless pit for any such trifle as that? We want to save the gal."

Before Cronk had ended his characteristic speech, Dennis was half-way up the ladder. He entered
the second story, only to be driven back by fire and smoke.

"A pole of some kind!" he cried.
